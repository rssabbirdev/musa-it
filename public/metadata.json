   "body": "I'm sure many of you have already heard this a thousand times, but I think it is important to talk about. Musicians \\(yes, EDM producers too\\) are more likely to suffer from depression than people who take different paths in life. We can speculate all day why depression and suicidal thoughts are so common in the music world, but I think the point is that we need to be aware of this and every now and then take a step back to relax and reflect on your current situation and mental health. I have lost 2 close friends to suicide, both were music creators and had big dreams of making a career in the music industry. One of my friends recently got to the point where he could make a living of streams and live gigs in the weekends. He was basically achieving his goals, yet he didn't become happier with his life, and like mentioned earlier he eventually ended his life. The point of this post is to remind you that you will not become happy just because you make it as a producer. Reaching the billboards, making millions, playing at festivals etc will not make you happy if you're not already happy with your life and what you are doing. Of course there are exceptions, but in general I would advise people not to give up on everything in life just to have a chance to succeed as a musician. Don't give up on your social life or family time if you are doing this in the search of happiness or money, because you will like proven by many successful people regret every minute you didn't spend with the ones you love. I apologize if I'm offending anyone with this post, and of course I don't have the answers to life, but I think we should be aware and have an open discussion about our mental health, especially in this industry. People spend so much time just to become the next Avicii, or pop icon or whatever because we think their lives are so much greater than ours, but in reality they are all somewhat envious of our simple not successful lives. All these guys you think are rich and happy are in reality super stressed out, loaded with anxiety, medications, depression, guilt, and the list goes on. So again, if you're making music because you want to become rich and famous, I would advise you to spend time with your family and friends instead. I'm just rambling on here because I'm very affected by the fact that yet another musician chose not to live, and it hurts to know that there are so many young people out there in a similar situation. How are you guys dealing with these things? Do you get depressed? Do you think success in music will affect your happiness or life quality? Is there any solutions to these problems that so many musicians has to face? Share your thoughts.",

   "body": "**What I've Spent the Past 6 years doing**\n\nI started with your casual loop infested trap beats, moved onto EDM (dubstep) and mainly focused on dubstep. Fast forward a few years, and I literally don't have a single track that I can proudly show anyone. Every single track I have, I will say prior that it's \"not finished\". Throughout these past years I've mainly focused on dubstep but have wrote some intros/drops for other genres as well. (progressive house, techno, lofi, minimal, tech house... etc) I've bought way too many synths, fx, mixing/mastering plugins in hopes of speeding up my process to be this  famous dj with my own sound that everyone likes. You know... the \"dream\"... I guess? I've learned FL Studio, Ableton to it's bones. I've spent countless hours watching tutorials/streams literally learning as much as I can. At this point I don't think there's a tutorial I haven't watched.\n\n**What's Got Me Down?**\n\nFor the past year, Every time I open ableton and stare at that blank project I get anxiety right off the bat. Truly speaking, my dream is to be playing at shows and playing dubstep specifically. I just want that and only that. I'll sound design a really dope synth, but can not come up with an idea or even flow with it. Even if I produce a 8 or 16 bar loop, I end up getting \"stuck\", listening to it on repeat while barely making any changes because I simply just don't know where I want to go next. Eventually, I'll either stop opening the project back up, or just attempt to continue and end up ruining it. I'll drive to work, listening to my favorite artists in my car, and wonder how the HELL they are making such GOOD QUALITY music, and so CONSISTENTLY.  In my eyes, and from what I've seen in tutorials, I'm doing what I need to do. Long story short, I feel like I should be able to at least finish or enjoy one of my tracks, but It's just not coming true.\n\n**What I Think My Problem Is**\n\nI truly believe I'm not inspired. I think I'm more than likely depressed, and the fact that I've been unable to even continue on a project more than 2 days for the past few years has added to my depression. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but since I left highschool, I've only worked a job, produced music, and played games on my PC.  I'm basically behind a computer 24/7. I used to workout, but gave that up as I figured I needed more time to \"produce\". I live with my parents at 23 years old. Parents are great, but just having that thought in the back of my head kind of affects me producing. I always felt like If i had my own place, I'd be able to write better music just knowing that I'm taking care of myself.  I have little to no social life. Majority of my past 4 years have been a cycle. Wake up, go to work, come home, open up ableton, struggle, close ableton, watch youtube or play games. I'd also like to state that I'm usually excited to produce, until I open up my DAW. I'll listen to my favorite tracks, telling myself in the car that I can do this, but get discouraged every single time.\n\n**Why I'm Posting This**\n\nI'm hoping someone has experienced this, and made a turn-around or has general advice for my situation. I believe that I should probably just stop opening up a DAW until I get my \"shit together\" as some would say. (get my own place, find a better paying job, etc). Probably best that in this time I also go out and experience life more as I think it will add fuel to my dream and probably inspire me.\n\nTLDR; I dropped everything at a young age, and focused on music production and feel into a depression hole\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: huge thank you to everyone who replied here, and those who DM'd me having similar issues. I've saved this page as it turned out to be much more helpful than I first expected. Great community. If anyone is looking for producer friends. I'm right here.

   "body": "Hey everybody!\n\nSo I’m an 18 yo guy and I’m at the end of my gap year. Now, I really need to look for what I’m going to do for the next few years. Not as what field I want to work in but what I’m going to do to be able to become a producer (cuz I already know I want to be a producer).\n\nSo, as I said in the title, I’m a beginner. A total beginner. I already know that some of you will think that I’m starting to look for what I’m going to do next year quite late and also that being an absolute beginner in music production at 18 but being sure that it’s what I want to do seems odd. I know. But I’m actually getting out of a kind of depression* only now (after ~3 years) and I finally feel like I’ll be able to start to produce and put the efforts needed.\n*It’s an actual depression, just not the common type like everyone has in mind when talking about that (being sad and not liking life all the time, etc.). What I had was more like not having any energy to make any efforts to do things. I was still very happy and enjoying life like everybody but at school it became very difficult for me to start working at home: I always started super late and did the bare minimum (some of you might have done that without suffering from a depression but what I mean globally is that I started to work less and less). And so yeah, even for things that I like or wanted to try like music production. Without this depression, I would have started a few years ago for sure.\n\nNow that you guys know about this, the real purpose of this post: what is best to do to start?\n\nI bought a new laptop with a program (macbook with logic) not a long time ago and that’s the first step but what next? Because of my depression, I feel like I need a class to help me get into it. I just won’t be able to start this alone. But I already asked about french or english classes on r/Belgium and r/TheNetherlands (I live in Belgium) and the ones that came back the most were Herman Brood and HKU. Problem: it’s clearly not for beginners. And I actually didn’t receive a lot of propositions for beginner classes. So first big question is: are there some beginner-level classes for music production in Belgium (or maybe Netherlands) in english or french? I’m genuinely afraid that there aren’t any.\n\nBut also, what can I do on my side to start? Of course I know that there are youtube tutorials (btw if you know a good channel, then please tell me!), but mainly, what other things could be great for me to begin that aren’t on youtube or isn’t a full cursus? (But it can be irl too, not only on internet)\n\nI really want to change my life and my objective atm would be to go to Herman Brood then HKU. If some of you know about Herman Brood, how long do you think it would take for a beginner to be able to apply there and having a chance of being accepted? (Not considering that I have to learn dutch so let’s say I already speak it) (To be more clear, when I would reach a level that it wouldn’t seem crazy to apply)\n\nAlso, I did already do 8 years of piano and 5 years of solfège (full cursus at my music academy). It’s a public academy so it’s the exact same level as every other public music academies in Belgium (national standards). Idk if it can change something but I guess it’s still something that should be pointed out.\n\nWell, I think that’s all! Thanks for reading everything and I hope you guys can help me. I really hope I’ll be able to turn around my life with music production. \n\nMessage posted also on r/musicproduction and r/WeAreTheMusicMakers\n\nUpdate: I took my time to write this so I wouldn’t forget anything. And during that time, I actually realised that main thing for which I lost all motivation is learning. I don’t like to learn anymore. I just want the end result. It doesn’t seem like a big thing but now I know more precisely why I don’t have any motivation for anything, rather than thinking it’s a global thing and not knowing where to start to change it. So if you guys have any tips so that the beginning (learning how to use the DAW, etc.) feels more enjoyable, it would be great!",

   "title": "How to Deal With the Mental Aspect of Producing.",
   "body": "Are you going crazy or just a producer? I see a lot of the same topics on the sub recently so I figured i would touch on some of the more mental stuff that i have dealt with on this 7 year journey of music. This might not apply to everyone on here, however it will help the ones who put a lot of pressure on themselves to be great. Even the hobby producers who want to excel in making music.\n\n**I suck**: This is doubt, nothing more. It comes and goes in waves usually with creativity. You may definitely not suck, but haven't been able to get something going in your last 10 even 30 sessions. Dont worry, STOP producing for awhile bc your wasting your time. You'll drive yourself into producer depression. Take as much time as you need away, can be a weekend or a month, doesn't matter. In the downtime, go on this sub, watch YouTube vids about producing, listen to music that you love even outside of edm. When you come back, you will be past the blockage, you will feel motivated again. These little breaks are like rest days athletes take to prevent over training. You dont see the result of the rest day until come back stronger than you were before. \n\n**Producer Depression**: This is one that not all will suffer from. The ones with tons of friends and lots of love dont get it as bad as the ones who lock away in the room for hours of isolation and fail miserably time and time again. This constant failing can eat at your soul after awhile, and you might begin to change your mood. You obsess over it and it becomes more important then your friends, job even your relationship. Its hard bc not everyone gets it, nor do they care. Its just you can your little computer music. They dont understand the pressure you put on yourself each day to progress so you can compete at the highest level. Its no different than an athlete with professional goals except it is very personal and goes unnoticed for a long time before people understand its a reality. I like the bumper sticker \"the worst day fishing, is better than the best day working\". I look at producing like that. Even in the beginning when i was in the room making terrible tracks, looking back it was so fun to me. I had to train myself not to take it personal, bc in the end im making beats. And whats better than making beats? Tell those your with, family, friends or girl how important it is to you and how much you enjoy it. Producer depression MURDERS creativity. \n\n**When a friend says \"i dont like your track\"**: This is like a bullet in the beginning, and maybe the track does suck, but you tried so damn hard! And your low key proud of it, so it stings when they dont like it. With time as you progress eventually they go hey, can i get that? This is when things change, they go dude you should add a sound here or actually help you. There will always be those who dont like it, and that is totally cool! With time its just comments on sc or youtube and your not attached to those, the good will always outweigh the bad, the fans speak for you. None of us like every track we hear and thats the beauty of what makes our own sound. Its what we like. \n\n**Creative Block** This happens, to everyone at all levels. There is something in your life that isn't letting your mind enter creative mode. Creative mode comes in waves. This wave can come for 4 days and leave for 12 days. External stress, money, job, sleep, WOMEN PROBS, drug use, booze, all these can keep you out of your zone.\n\nThese keep you in the zone: STABILITY, PEACE, SEX. Good women who you can trust and support your life. Having an active sex life besides bad websites. Sex is in maslows hierarchy of needs for a reason, humans need sex. Exercise, can be gym, surf or skate. Something fun where you move and break a sweat. Regular diet, not starving or eating candy for 2 days. The brain needs more than caffeine and nicotine to function, it needs nutrients so feed it. Sometimes if you got a good idea down, but you cant figure the rest out, take a drive and get something to eat or make some food bc food its helps. Getting enough sleep, this is important bc again no sleep = stress, and stress = low creativity. Have a good workplace with minimum traffic and interruption. This doesnt have to be a crazy studio, it can be as simple as not having your studio in the living room where your roommates have people over every night. Invest in headphones if you have to. Producing is very personal, even if its not just you, you need to be able to tap into your zone. Stability, is how can you produce when the rents due and you dont have enough money. How can you be creative if you have some crazy gf who wants to bit** all the time. Make your life stable if producing is your passion, set your life up to have the necessary time you need to achieve it. \n\n**Depression and Burnout** - This is the feeling when your failing bad across the board. This is the lowest of lows for a producer. Cant focus, quit shaving, no chicks, too many chicks, not eating, not sleeping, reg drug and booze use, but your still grinding. Still trying to crack the code, reading this sub, YouTube, and going hard on the beats but just not quite there. This is when you step back, go to the barber, get some new clothes and freshen up. Stop self medicating, cut back on the weed, beer, or whatever else you do that you prob shouldn't be doing. Eat normal, do everything in stability peace and sex. This will LEVEL YOU UP and you will be clear headed again. It can take time, your not gonna get any better if you fall into this category. You need to take time off and analyze whats happening. Neglecting the signs of the burnout can be fatal, producer death. These are the ones who quit, they hate music and they're bitter. Keep the mind good at ALL TIMES, naturally good not xanny good. Burnout happens at the higher levels too. Endless travel, time zones, time limits on everything, too many women, partying, drugs, booze. You see guys make it all the time then fall off. Or guys who absolutely can produce, who start collabing all the time or buying tracks. Its not always bc they cant do it, its bc their life is no longer set up to do it. Its set up to make money and keep making money. Its very easy to get lazy, however if you have a sickening addiction to making music, let this carry you. This is whats gonna open new doors in your career to make even bigger moves in the long run. \n\n\n\n\nHOPE THIS HELPS!",

   "body": "Hey guys so look i have this deep passion for making music ( drake/ g eazy / bryson tiller type of music ) I'm really obsessed with music i just love it i feel like that's what I'm here to do .. to make music forever and get paid doing it ... when I'm not making music or thinking about making music i feel dead inside / depressed asf . Anyways i want to drop out of dental school cuz im in my third year and i got  3 years left (we study 6 years of dental school in my country ) so it's so much work and it's not helping me with music. So i want to risk it all drop out of it to chase music full time. The only problem is that i live in a third world country so there's no labels here . So my plan is to use my instagram make some buzz here to get noticed by big artists so i might get signed by one of them and go to the US or just take a plane and go there looking for labels to sign me. \nIf i don't make it then i might end up with nothing no diploma no education and I've been considering it a lot lately but at the same time scared that it won't work out and some ppl i know would love to see me end up broke with no promising future and ofc my mom will be crushed too as soon as I drop out .. and when im gonna drop out im scared of how my reaction would be too because my friends will finishing their diploma and I'll be \" the guy who dropped out to chase music \" i feel like im gonna look like a fool...and one of my friends told me that if you wanna do it you gotta do it right from the get go not do it and drop it half way ... an other friend of mine said i should chase it after I'm done with dental school but i will be 28 ( im about to be 25 btw ) then i might be too old to do that and I'd be less motivated to do it soo  ...  idk i just feel like it's the right thing to do ( chasing it) but at the same time wondering if I'm just being delusional and romanticizing the idea of being a famous rapper with all the cars hoes and cribs ... So should I just go for it or is it a dumb idea ? And just chase it like a hobby ( like Making songs in the studio just for the love of music and not drop anything or consider a career )",

Hey guys so look i have this deep passion for making music   drake/ g eazy / bryson tiller type of music   I'm really obsessed with music i just love it i feel like that's what I'm here to do .. to make music forever and get paid doing it ... when I'm not making music or thinking about making music i feel dead inside / depressed asf . Anyways i want to drop out of dental school cuz im in my third year and i got  3 years left  we study 6 years of dental school in my country   so it's so much work and it's not helping me with music. So i want to risk it all drop out of it to chase music full time. The only problem is that i live in a third world country so there's no labels here . So my plan is to use my instagram make some buzz here to get noticed by big artists so i might get signed by one of them and go to the US or just take a plane and go there looking for labels to sign me. \nIf i don't make it then i might end up with nothing no diploma no education and I've been considering it a lot lately but at the same time scared that it won't work out and some ppl i know would love to see me end up broke with no promising future and ofc my mom will be crushed too as soon as I drop out .. and when im gonna drop out im scared of how my reaction would be too because my friends will finishing their diploma and I'll be \" the guy who dropped out to chase music \" i feel like im gonna look like a fool...and one of my friends told me that if you wanna do it you gotta do it right from the get go not do it and drop it half way ... an other friend of mine said i should chase it after I'm done with dental school but i will be 28   im about to be 25 btw   then i might be too old to do that and I'd be less motivated to do it soo  ...  idk i just feel like it's the right thing to do   chasing it  but at the same time wondering if I'm just being delusional and romanticizing the idea of being a famous rapper with all the cars hoes and cribs ... So should I just go for it or is it a dumb idea ? And just chase it like a hobby   like Making songs in the studio just for the love of music and not drop anything or consider a career   https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/mbz2jf/should_i_do_it/",

   "title": "A couple interesting (but simple) things I noticed while analyzing \"LRAD\" by Knife Party.",
   "body": "Hey everyone! I was going over some subjectively clean mixes, and I came across a couple neat points about [**this track here**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aEBlLMyN_0).\n\nI was looking at a spectrum analyzer, and noticed a [**pretty narrow and exaggerated depression in the spectrum during the intro of the track.**](http://i.imgur.com/CPcfIoP.png) Right below 320Hz, you can clearly see what I'm talking about. \n\nHowever, during the drop, you can see that the percussive lead [**completely fills in this area**](http://i.imgur.com/ZEsc0x9.png) at the same level as the sub of the kick drum.\n\nInterestingly enough, that offbeat 'blip' sound that happens at the beginning of each 2 bars [**occupies the area of the spectrum just above this depression in the EQ.**](http://i.imgur.com/11mRV67.png) (Spike just above 320Hz)\n\n[**Here's a link with all three images stacked so you can easier see the relation between these elements.**](http://i.imgur.com/Afs5bwB.png)\n\nSo with all that being said, we can dig a bit deeper and try to understand these decisions. It seems apparent that the mix (minus percussive lead during the drop) was EQ'ed in this way to make the drop hit even harder. For the entire intro, this area of the spectrum was withheld from the listeners, and when that lead comes in, it fills in a void that we didn't even realize was present. Furthermore, the 'blip' sitting right above this area of the spectrum sort of teased our ears a bit, kind of like withholding the root note of a song during the verse and hitting it on the first beat of the chorus. In this case, the 'blip' is building tension and the synth is that root that comes in at full force.\n\nAlso, this track is very loud. There isn't much dynamic range. When you've got a very small RMS, you've got to think of other ways to introduce dynamics. I don't think this is a technical term, but it seems like Knife Party has introduced some frequency-based dynamics here. There isn't much distinction between loud and quiet, so they made a distinction between the lead and the rest of the track. This kind of creates a dynamic in and of itself.\n\nAll of this seems pretty obvious, but I feel it's a valuable thing to point out and bring to the attention of the community here, because this opens a whole can of worms for creative ways to really make your track stand out. \n\nAs producers, we're always looking for ways to make a chorus more energetic, make a drop hit harder, or separate sections of a song from one another; commonly, people say things like \"automate the volume of your drop to raise by a dB or two when it comes in\", or \"filter out the lows during your build and bring them back in for the drop\". These are great suggestions, but they've been used over and over. Now this isn't a rallying cry to push the limits of production or anything like that, I just think it's valuable to think of creative ways to make your different elements stand out, as Knife Party did here. \n\nI'm sure that other professional tracks use similar techniques to this, so if anyone has an example they'd like to share, do it! Do your own analysis of your favorite mixdowns and try to find little tricks like this - it could be very beneficial to your workflow and music in general.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to add that my analysis definitely isn't guaranteed to be accurate. For all I know, this could be a coincidence, I could be reading into things, or they may have done this for a completely different reason such as simply making room for the lead in the mix. This is just my speculation.\n",

As soon as I sit down to write a track I have the worst anxiety just knowing it's going to suck.

It's rarely an enjoyable experience for me because I critique myself so harshly I just can't enjoy it. \n\nI also have ADD which strongly impacts my decision making, confusion of not knowing where to start, and overall feeling like a failure.

I’ve made probably a 100 or so draft tracks of various completion now and i have a whole album mostly written including lyrics and all. But because I can't finish any of that stuff, I've committed myself to just making and finishing a single track, so now I'm literally just trying to make a simple and derivative synthwave track along the lines of HOME/songs released on Electronic Gems, and i’m using reference tracks for it too so that I have a guide.

Not to impress anyone but myself. I think it is a mindset issue more than lacking technical knowledge but i don’t  know.

   "body": "Hello EDM Production, I'm an Audio Engineering student from Melbourne, and I am currently writing an academic thesis based on music therapy (focusing on music therapy as a treatment for depression).\n\nAs part of my primary research, I have formulated a basic questionnaire for analysis. I'm hoping to gain 50 respondents to this survey within the next two weeks, and thought I would try posting it in here.  While this post is not based on production, I feel that the topic of music and emotion may be an interesting reminder for producers nonetheless.\n\nQuestions are based on the emotional relationship between music and state of mind/mood. I would really appreciate as many responses to this as possible, and am happy to share the results of this thesis with anyone interested.\n\nI have included an ethical consent form in this thread, which all respondents are required to read - completing the questionnaire presumes that you have read this.\n\nIf respondents could please make their responses clear when submitting a reply message here that would be great. Alternatively, you can copy the text and email your responses to me via email: burns.elliot@gmail.com\n\nI will copy and paste the ethical consent form along with the questionnaire in this post.  It makes for a huge post, but taking the time to go through this would help a brother out immensely :)\nIt should take roughly 10 minutes to complete.\nMany thanks!\n\n\nEthical Research Consent Form:\n\nDear Respondent,\n \nI am inviting you participate in a research project to study the benefits of music therapy as a treatment for depression. Along with this letter is a short questionnaire that asks a variety of questions about your emotional responses to music.  I am asking you to look over the questionnaire and, if you choose to do so, complete and return it back to me.  It should take you no longer than 10 minutes to complete.\n\nThe results of this project will be analyzed in order to compile statistics based on music preferences and emotional responses.  Through your participation, I hope to understand how your emotion and music choice are related, and whether this relation can highlight any psychological benefits of music.  I hope that the results of the survey will be useful for compiling this information and seeking to better understand this relationship, and I hope to share my results by publishing them in an academic research thesis.\n\nI do not know of any risks to you if you decide to participate in this survey and I guarantee that your responses will remain completely confidential; no personally identifiable information will be published or shared as a result of this questionnaire.  Therefore, you are not required to put your name on the questionnaire.\n\nShould you wish to fill this questionnaire out and return it to me digitally, you can email it to the following address:\n\nburns.elliot@gmail.com\n\nI hope you will take the time to complete this questionnaire and return it. Your participation is completely voluntary.  Regardless of whether you choose to participate, please let me know if you would like a summary of my findings. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about completing the questionnaire or about being in this study, you may contact me via the email address listed above.  This project has been approved by JMC ACADEMY.\n\nIf you have any questions about your rights as a research study participant, you may contact the Head of Department for this study, Rob Care 03 9624 2929.\n\nIf you agree to participate, you may keep this form and complete the survey.\nIf you wish, you may stop at any time.\n Sincerely. \n\nElliot Burns, JMC Academy thesis student.\n\n\nAUD401 – PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE:\n\n1.\tHow often does your choice of music reflect your mood?\n(Never/Rarely/Occasionally/Frequently/Very Frequently)\n\n2.\tHow often do you feel that listening to music is beneficial to your mood?\n(Never/Not Often/Often/Very Often/All The Time)\n\n3.\tWould you consider participating in music therapy as an alternative treatment for depression or anxiety?\n(Yes/No)\n\n4.\tWould you consider participating in music therapy as a treatment option before considering prescription medication?\n(Yes/No)\n\n5.\tHow strongly do you believe that your musical preferences reflect your personality?\n(Strongly Disagree/Disagree/Undecided/Agree/Strongly Agree)\n\n6.\tHow likely are you to listen to music when you feel upset?\n(Very Unlikely/Unlikely/Likely/Very Likely)\n\n7.\tHow many hours a week do you spend listening to music?\n(0-1/1-3/3-5/5+)\n\n8.\tPlease answer the following statement: “The music I listen to can greatly influence my current mood.”\n(Strongly Disagree/Somewhat Disagree/Neither Agree Nor Disagree/Somewhat Agree/Strongly Agree)\n\n9.\tDo you believe that an alternative treatment method such as music therapy is a valuable option for treating depression and anxiety?\n(Yes/No)\n\n10.\t How likely are you to listen to uplifting music when you are in a good mood?\n(Very Unlikely/Unlikely/Likely/Very Likely)\n\n11.\t Do you believe that music therapy should be a treatment option from all counsellors/psychologists treating depression and anxiety?\n(Yes/No)\n\n12.\t Do you believe that listening to music can be beneficial for anyone?\n(Yes/No)\n\n13.\t Do you believe that age has anything to do with the effectiveness of music therapy?\n(Yes/No)\n\n14.\t What age group are you in?

It makes for a huge post, but taking the time to go through this would help a brother out immensely : \nIt should take roughly 10 minutes to complete.\nMany thanks!\n\n\nEthical Research Consent Form:\n\nDear Respondent,\n \nI am inviting you participate in a research project to study the benefits of music therapy as a treatment for depression. Along with this letter is a short questionnaire that asks a variety of questions about your emotional responses to music.  I am asking you to look over the questionnaire and, if you choose to do so, complete and return it back to me.  It should take you no longer than 10 minutes to complete.\n\nThe results of this project will be analyzed in order to compile statistics based on music preferences and emotional responses.  Through your participation, I hope to understand how your emotion and music choice are related, and whether this relation can highlight any psychological benefits of music.  I hope that the results of the survey will be useful for compiling this information and seeking to better understand this relationship, and I hope to share my results by publishing them in an academic research thesis.\n\nI do not know of any risks to you if you decide to participate in this survey and I guarantee that your responses will remain completely confidential; no personally identifiable information will be published or shared as a result of this questionnaire.  Therefore, you are not required to put your name on the questionnaire.\n\nShould you wish to fill this questionnaire out and return it to me digitally, you can email it to the following address:\n\nburns.elliot@gmail.com\n\nI hope you will take the time to complete this questionnaire and return it. Your participation is completely voluntary.  Regardless of whether you choose to participate, please let me know if you would like a summary of my findings. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about completing the questionnaire or about being in this study, you may contact me via the email address listed above.  This project has been approved by JMC ACADEMY.\n\nIf you have any questions about your rights as a research study participant, you may contact the Head of Department for this study, Rob Care 03 9624 2929.\n\nIf you agree to participate, you may keep this form and complete the survey.\nIf you wish, you may stop at any time.\n Sincerely. \n\nElliot Burns, JMC Academy thesis student.\n\n\nAUD401 – PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE:\n\n1.\tHow often does your choice of music reflect your mood?\n Never/Rarely/Occasionally/Frequently/Very Frequently \n\n2.\tHow often do you feel that listening to music is beneficial to your mood?\n Never/Not Often/Often/Very Often/All The Time \n\n3.\tWould you consider participating in music therapy as an alternative treatment for depression or anxiety?\n Yes/No \n\n4.\tWould you consider participating in music therapy as a treatment option before considering prescription medication?\n Yes/No \n\n5.\tHow strongly do you believe that your musical preferences reflect your personality?\n Strongly Disagree/Disagree/Undecided/Agree/Strongly Agree \n\n6.\tHow likely are you to listen to music when you feel upset?\n Very Unlikely/Unlikely/Likely/Very Likely \n\n7.\tHow many hours a week do you spend listening to music?\n 0-1/1-3/3-5/5+ \n\n8.\tPlease answer the following statement: “The music I listen to can greatly influence my current mood.”\n Strongly Disagree/Somewhat Disagree/Neither Agree Nor Disagree/Somewhat Agree/Strongly Agree \n\n9.\tDo you believe that an alternative treatment method such as music therapy is a valuable option for treating depression and anxiety?\n Yes/No \n\n10.\t How likely are you to listen to uplifting music when you are in a good mood?\n Very Unlikely/Unlikely/Likely/Very Likely \n\n11.\t Do you believe that music therapy should be a treatment option from all counsellors/psychologists treating depression and anxiety?\n Yes/No \n\n12.\t Do you believe that listening to music can be beneficial for anyone?\n Yes/No \n\n13.\t Do you believe that age has anything to do with the effectiveness of music therapy?\n Yes/No \n\n14.\t What age group are you in?

   "title": "Tips from 12 years of music production and composition experience",
   "body": "(Repost of a reply to another thread.) \n\nBest of luck!\n\n(In no particular order)\n\n* Drums + Rhythm - using MPD pad drums with Melodics, as well as an eDrum set I picked up recently. This as an exercise in **internalizing and feeling the drum groove vs. just hearing it**. This has taken my production to a much higher level over the past few years.\n* Mixing Technique - Very important fundamentals like **turning down the Gain on your Limiter vs. smacking it all the time**, you want to preserve your dynamic range instead of relying on the limiter. Like **being aware of what space you want each instrument in the mix** **to be in,** and shaping it, maybe cutting out the low end on instruments that you don't want sub frequencies on (not a hard and fast rule, but an important idea to understand. high hats and lead synths not being a bass instrument, tyyyypically.), **how to create sexy delay and reverb combos** with vocals, synths, pianos, drums, (I love to send an instrument to a delay, then to a reverb, automating how much delay signal goes to the master, how much goes to the reverb). Understanding **how to shape stereo width of instruments** using a combination of doubling instruments on L/R, mid-side processing (the stereo width knob on your mixing board in FL), panning, chorus/flanger/phaser effects, stereo - delay (eg: Ping-Pong Delay, like Deadmau5 synths) and reverb. **I used to rely on reverb to create \"Big\"**, but these days, I use a combination of all of the above, and can achieve a \"Big Lush\" sound, and can use reverb automation to make it even BIGGER.\n* Production Technique - This comes with experience, but things like **how to shape the energy level across a song**, how to create high energy and tension, and when to release it, often with transition effects, risers, drum builds, opening up the filter on your synths, and white noise sweeps. Learning how to shape white noise with filter and gain automation has been a great tool for me. Using \"sidechain\" style volume ducking (Gross Beat, LFOTool). **Getting my desired texture with my drums** (saturation/waveshaping, pitching, low-passing, reverb/delay.)\n* **Getting to know how your synths work -** through a study of basic modular synthesis, **your** **ADSR, your filter, your oscillators, your LFOs, your modulation,** your signal chain on top of it. My production game, especially with EDM has improved so much by applying modular synthesis technique to my synths, because I can think of a sound I want to make, and make it on the spot - whether I want a riser, a lead synth, a nasty Reese Supersaw Bass, some progressive house chord plucks, some swelling lush chords, some future bass wobbly chords.\n* Bass Sound Design - Going further with modular synthesis, I just picked up Serum (same outcomes as your Massive, Massive X, Vital etc. modular wavetable synths.) and I'm learning to apply these same fundamentals to creating those ultra-grimey DnB, Electro and Dubstep bass synths. (Stranjah has tons on this, love that guy!) Plus mixing your bass with foley effects and processing techniques.\n* Sampling / SFX - a lot of your unique style as a producer comes from your use of Samples and SFX. The genres you lean toward can influence that a lot. If you're an aggressive \"Pop EDM\" style producer, that would lend to a lot of vocal chops and modern sounding drums. I love lush, organic textures, soundscapes, foley to add to a sense of space to my songs. You can go pretty far sampling yourself, or you can sample other vocalists, find sample packs / free sound libraries online.\n* Developing your Catalog of Tools - Instruments, Samples, SFX - you can go so far these days for free, if you know where to look, and how to use your tools. I'm still using the same sample packs I picked up from Computer Music CDs back in 2011. I also have found great free sample packs for specific things, eg: LoFi Drums, or world percussion, or nature ambiences. Find free reverb, saturation, delay, flanger etc plugins you love. Find a workhorse synth you love. (I use FL's Minisynth on almost every track, because it's an easy to use subtractive synth. I use Serum when I need more options.)\n* Libraries - Spitfire LABS and Pianobook have exceptional free resources for cinematic libraries. I've also invested significantly in Cinematic Sound libraries because I'm also a music composer (Komplete, Spitfire) These things have come with time.\n* Learn a hands-on instrument - going deep with a hands on instrument can teach you music theory lessons no course can teach you. **I learned 95% of my music theory by sitting down at a piano and teaching myself by banging the keys**. Whether it's guitar, piano, drums or something else, it can help distinguish your unique style. I love my piano skills because I can play the parts I have in my head, or plug them into the piano roll quickly.\n* Find mentors with specific skills you want to learn - Stranjah (such amazing DnB tutorials) and Au5 have been my \"bass synthesis\" mentors. Venus Theory has excellent music theory and cinematic production tutorials (things I self-taught pretty much entirely, so I don't watch his videos except for the sound design and sampling he does). Oversampled has great Pop EDM sound design wizardry. Look around and you'll find someone to spend time learning with.\n* Recreating songs from other producers - this is a great place to get the fundamentals down and **give you a strong toolbelt to improvise with.** You'll learn how songs are made, how unique sounds are achieved, how energy is managed across a song, and how tracks are arranged. You can also do this with \"hands on\" instruments. I did this with piano learning composers, so I could improvise using their techniques.\n* Get to know your DAW - one of the most satisfying feelings is knowing how to achieve the result you have in mind. Knowing your keybinds, shortcuts, utilities lets you stay in the flow. This is why I never produce with a touchpad. Anything I can do to get the DAW out of the way so I can shape my music, the better. - without wasting 5 minutes fiddling with your DAW.\n* Start with Why - **Discover the real stories, the soul, the struggle, behind the genre you want to write in**. For Drum and Bass and EDM, writing inspired pieces of music, versus just \"interesting tracks\" has been connecting to the WHY. For me it's freedom, self-expression, it's \"everyone who's not gonna let me be free, can fuck off.\" **For me, it's been studying and internalizing the stories of Goldie, the synthesis of breaking, emceeing, graffiti and DJing of hip-hop in UK street culture**, and its roots in Reggae Dub, Jungle and DnB. How US EDM started in Chicago and Detroit clubs (many LGBT)... this music as a primal drive for freedom, connection, dance, catharsis and self-expression. For me this has helped me connect with the heart, the humanity in the music versus just writing \"a mad sick banger.\"\n* I believe creativity is **one part technique and one part ideas/inspiration**. If you want to write inspired music, it's not going to happen depressed locked behind a computer. Live! Love! Laugh! Have fun. Adventure. The music will come, and you'll have the hard skills to write it down when it happens.\n\n:)",

I've only been producing seriously for 4 or 5 months now, but I have messed around with producing probably once or twice a week in the past 4 years.  It was small stuff, getting bored and making beats, or just putting random sounds together.  Anyways, not really making music, just messing around\n\nA few months ago, for some reason I really got into producing.  I started reading all sorts of stuff on music theory and doubled my youtube tutorial intake (I used to watch a lot of videos, but never really did much with the info from them before).  The music I made in the first couple months was terrible, though.  But the thing is I had a ton of fun doing it, and it was really easy.  I could get an \"outline\" or \"sketch\"  of a song done in 5-6 hours (now it takes me anywhere from 10-20 hours) and then finish (well... if you can call it that) in 15.

We're back with genre competition #4. This genre was invented by our previous winner, [maplesyrupismajestic](https://soundcloud.com/iamae).\n\n  **Your mission is to create a track in the following fictitious genre. Interpret this genre description however you wish, and create a song that fulfills your vision of this genre. You may use any sound sources you desire in this competition.**\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Genre: Etiamunda**\n\n  \n  **Tempo: Adagio, 66 - 76 beats per minute.**\n\n  **Time signature: 4/4, 6/8, or 7/4.**\n\n  **Instrumentation:**\n\n  * Natural percussion, especially tonal-mallet instruments (marimba, vibraphone, etc.)\n\n  * Long droning chords in deep pads and airy harmonics.\n\n  * And highly rhythmical synths with shorter articulations such such as pizzicato, trills, glissando, staccato, marcato, etc.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n \n* History: Sheet music recently discovered in an old stone hovel unearthed in an excavation in Cumbria gives us Etiamunda as the first hint at modern music composition. Cumbria is the place where the musical Skiddaw Stones were discovered in the early 1800s and the person who discovered them had also been, we have good reason to think, highly trained in classical instrumentation. Mixing the two elements of the Stones and classical instruments the composer discovered new worlds in music that no other before had attempted.\n\n* Structure: Inspired by the long rolling hills in Cumbria, the composer decided that music should be written in even ratios: for every crescendo there must also be an equal decrescendo. Based upon this simple formula, the composition structures used were: ABA, ABCBA, AABBAA, ABCCBA.\nIn fact 'Etiamunda' roughly translates from Latin as \"Even Wave.\"\n\n* Time frame: After analysis of the nearly 400 of the compositions we've discovered that no composition the composer wrote in Etiamunda exceeded 1:40 seconds. It's still one of the great mysteries of music as to why this was, but the leading theory is that the forum in which all of the pieces were performed was outdoors and no stringed instrument of the time could stay in tune for that period of time outside.\n\n**Ancillary:**\n\n* Cumbria is a cold place for most of the year. The land and forests are dark green and the rocky hills dark gray. Compound this with the fact that it rains there often and is as often foggy, the nature of most of the pieces are extremely solemn and depressing. To achieve this the composer often used the Dorian and Phrygian modes when not using the natural minor scale.\n\n* In a note found in a journal the composer wrote the following: \"The system of waves coming in from the ocean is miraculous: they are at first shallow and even, then they build and build, then at the apotheosis they crash with magnificent thunder and slowly return back into themselves until they are but a trickle on the beach. Should not everything in life be the same? Should not every music be so modeled?\"\n\n* Sometimes but not always the compositions would change time signature and key at the climax of the piece then return to the original time signature at the decrescendo.\n\n* Natural harmonics within the strings were employed often.\n\n(Let it be known formatting this was an absolute bitch)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  After you've finished your track, upload it to soundcloud as a private track and send the secret link in a PM to [myself](http://reddit.com/u/Doomsaloto) or [DinosaurHospital](http://reddit.com/u/DinosaurHospital). \n\n\n**Important Question: Should the deadline for the third genre competition be in two weeks, or three? Would an additional week encourage more people to take part?**",

   "body": "This is real cutting edge stuff, guys. Recently, phonon has released a song called polyriddim and it's making waves in the EDM community. It's dubstep, which isn't anything new, but it totally upends the genre. Most dubstep is in 4/4 meter but polyriddim blends 7/4 meter with the usual 4/4, and I personally have never heard anything like it.  I've attached a video I made that tracks the meter changes throughout the song. The accent marks (>) above the notes show where a beat is accented by the synths or the kick.\n\nThis song is proving to be divisive in the EDM community. A lot of people are criticizing it because it's nearly impossible to headbang to it, while others are praising it as a refreshing experiment in EDM production. I'm a fan of it personally because meter and rhythm hasn't been a widely explored area of EDM and I think it could pave the way for some really interesting new music.\n\nFrom a more artsy perspective, it's an accurate portrayal of what's going on in the world right now. When the drop hits, the asymmetric rhythm and plucky synth creates a sense of disturbance and confusion that only grows more chaotic as it continues. To me, this encapsulates the general sentiments of stir-craziness and depression/anxiety that's being felt by the world in midst of the COVID quarantine. The whole aesthetic of the polyriddim is \"wtf is going on,\" and generally, no one knows wtf is going on or wtf to do or how long we're going to be on lockdown. The Coronavirus has thrown our ways of life into disarray, and the panicked, confused feeling that has come from this upheaval is captured well by this song.\n\nJust my thoughts.

I'm a fan of it personally because meter and rhythm hasn't been a widely explored area of EDM and I think it could pave the way for some really interesting new music.\n\nFrom a more artsy perspective, it's an accurate portrayal of what's going on in the world right now. When the drop hits, the asymmetric rhythm and plucky synth creates a sense of disturbance and confusion that only grows more chaotic as it continues. To me, this encapsulates the general sentiments of stir-craziness and depression/anxiety that's being felt by the world in midst of the COVID quarantine. The whole aesthetic of the polyriddim is \"wtf is going on,\" and generally, no one knows wtf is going on or wtf to do or how long we're going to be on lockdown. The Coronavirus has thrown our ways of life into disarray, and the panicked, confused feeling that has come from this upheaval is captured well by this song.\n\nJust my thoughts. Lemme know what you think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove, Sh!t Bird\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/gjufsv/video/8gpr513pjsy41/player https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/gjufsv/polyriddim_by_phonon_explained/",

You may use any sound sources you desire in this competition.\n\nGenre: Etiamunda\n\nTempo: Adagio, 66 - 76 beats per minute.\n\nTime signature: 4/4, 6/8, or 7/4.\n\nInstrumentation:\n\n    Natural percussion, especially tonal-mallet instruments (marimba, vibraphone, etc.)\n\n    Long droning chords in deep pads and airy harmonics.\n\n    And highly rhythmical synths with shorter articulations such such as pizzicato, trills, glissando, staccato, marcato, etc.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\n    History: Sheet music recently discovered in an old stone hovel unearthed in an excavation in Cumbria gives us Etiamunda as the first hint at \n\nmodern music composition. Cumbria is the place where the musical Skiddaw Stones were discovered in the early 1800s and the person who discovered \n\nthem had also been, we have good reason to think, highly trained in classical instrumentation. Mixing the two elements of the Stones and classical \n\ninstruments the composer discovered new worlds in music that no other before had attempted.\n\n    Structure: Inspired by the long rolling hills in Cumbria, the composer decided that music should be written in even ratios: for every crescendo \n\nthere must also be an equal decrescendo. Based upon this simple formula, the composition structures used were: ABA, ABCBA, AABBAA, ABCCBA. In fact \n\n'Etiamunda' roughly translates from Latin as \"Even Wave.\"\n\n    Time frame: After analysis of the nearly 400 of the compositions we've discovered that no composition the composer wrote in Etiamunda exceeded \n\n1:40 seconds. It's still one of the great mysteries of music as to why this was, but the leading theory is that the forum in which all of the pieces \n\nwere performed was outdoors and no stringed instrument of the time could stay in tune for that period of time outside.\n\nAncillary:\n\n    Cumbria is a cold place for most of the year. The land and forests are dark green and the rocky hills dark gray. Compound this with the fact \n\nthat it rains there often and is as often foggy, the nature of most of the pieces are extremely solemn and depressing.

   "title": "How to Overcome Writer's Block when Writing Music",
   "body": "Hey EDM Fam,\n\nI originally posted this in the r/Songwriting sub and thought it could be helpful to you guys as well.\n\n*Shoot me a message if you would like the PDF version.*\n\n# The Challenge\n\nWe've all been there. The struggle to get started. The lack of inspiration. And as a result, the feeling of absent originality when creating ideas.\n\nYou might know **where to start** but **not how to finish** a track. You might also struggle with an artistic block or feel unmotivated to write – like nothing sounds or feels good enough.\n\nI will share and explain the things I've put in place that helped me overcome writer's block with any song, music or video production.\n\nI apologize for the length. I just wanted to share all my ideas with you to then pick and choose what works best for you, and hope you never have a problem sitting down to produce or write a song again. Bear in mind that some sections apply more to writing lyrics than to writing instrumentals.\n\n# 1. Keep a journal of ideas via playlists and bookmarks\n\nOne of the best ways to overcome writer's block is to keep a journal of ideas. Journaling ideas can be done in a few ways: **(1)** **creating playlists of songs that inspire you**, **(2) bookmarking relevant websites,** and **(3) saving articles with songwriting tips**. These methods will help you stay organized and motivated and help you find inspiration when you need it.\n\nHere are some things you need to ask yourself when journaling:\n\n## What interests you?\n\nYou can find inspiration from interests by exploring music scores, genres, styles, and eras, looking at artwork, and reading poetry. You can also find inspiration by spending time in nature and talking to other songwriters. Exploring different mediums allows you to find new and exciting ways to be inspired and produce unique and compelling songs.\n\n## Who are your favourite artists?\n\nInspiration for musical ideas comes from listening to your favourite musicians and music producers. Examining their music can help you get in the right frame of mind to write your songs and give you ideas for new melodies or chords. You can also learn a lot about songwriting by studying your favourite artists' musical styles and various works.\n\n## What are important personal experiences?\n\nThese can be happy or sad memories, moments that made you laugh or cry, or events that changed your life. When you write about personal experiences, you can connect with your listeners on a deeper level, and they will be able to relate to your songs more easily. Additionally, writing from the heart can help you write more honest and emotionally powerful songs. Your life experiences will give you a wealth of material to write about.\n\n## What are you passionate about? What drives you?\n\nYour passion is what will make your songs unique and compelling. When you write about passionate topics, your enthusiasm will shine through your music, connecting with your listeners. By writing about things that matter to you, you can produce songs that have the power to inspire and motivate others.\n\n## What genres of music do you enjoy listening to?\n\nBy exploring different genres of music, you can find new and exciting ideas to incorporate into your own songs. You can also better understand how other musical elements work together to create a specific sound or mood. Also, listening to different music can help you expand your musical vocabulary and develop your unique style.\n\n## What other art forms do you enjoy?\n\nLike music, other art forms can also be a source of inspiration for your songwriting. By exploring different types of art, you can find new ways to express yourself and create original and innovative songs. For example, studying other art forms can help you better understand using music to convey emotion and create a specific mood. Try this as a songwriting challenge: replicate a different style of music/song than the genre you're comfortable with.\n\n# 2. Get organized and develop an action plan\n\nYou have to get organized.\n\nAnd I don't mean only organizing your sound sample packs or your project tracks. I mean organize your life, day, and tasks.\n\nOrganization starts with **(1)** **creating an action plan** and **setting achievable goals**. Having a clear goal in mind will make you more motivated and likely to achieve your target. Additionally, by **(2)** **setting deadlines** for yourself, you will be less likely to procrastinate and more likely to stay on track. Finally, **(3)** **developing a routine** and **sticking to it**. Set aside time each day to write and make sure that you stick to your schedule.\n\n## Create a Songwriting/Production Schedule\n\nSet realistic goals, and make sure that you allocate enough time to achieve them.\n\nStart by setting a goal of writing one song per week. If you cannot write a complete song in one sitting, break it down into smaller goals.\n\nFor example, you could set a goal of writing the lyrics for one song per week and the melody for another.\n\nOnce you have completed a few songs, you can increase the frequency and quantity of your output.\n\nSet yourself a songwriting challenge at least once a month and see how it goes— the results will surprise you.\n\n## Establish Goals\n\nWhen starting a new song, having specific and achievable goals is essential.\n\nSome examples of specific goals include:\n\n* Write a song with a minimum of four chords\n* Write a song in the key of C major or A minor\n* Write a song with a verse and chorus\n* Write a song that is under three minutes in length\n\nAchieving these goals will help improve your songwriting skills and technique and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\n## Find Inspiration\n\nOne of the best ways to find inspiration for your songwriting is to listen to music. In addition, you can get new ideas and learn about different musical styles by listening to other music.\n\nIn addition to listening to music, you can also find inspiration in other art forms, such as painting, dance, or film. Another great way to find inspiration is simply taking a walk and allowing your mind to wander.\n\nSometimes, the best ideas come when you least expect them.\n\n## Develop a Style\n\nOne of the best ways to develop your musical style is to listen to a wide variety of music: the more songs, the better. And sometimes, you have to **listen** to and **study music** outside your comfort zone.\n\nAs you listen, pay attention to the different **elements** of each song.\n\nSome things to consider include:\n\n* Overall mood or feeling\n* Instruments\n* Tempo\n* Melody\n* Lyrics\n* Rhythm\n* Harmony\n\nBy understanding how these elements fit and work together, you can start to develop your style. Also, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. The more you experiment, the more you will learn about what works for you and what doesn't – keep sharpening your songwriting composition skills.\n\n# 3. Practice, practice, practice\n\nThe best way to improve any skill is to practice every day. By committing to writing and producing regularly, you will quickly see results.\n\n**Results create momentum**. And momentum gives you the necessary energy and motivation to drive through pain and grow.\n\nYou should practice a set of the following skills **every** single day:\n\n## Write lyrics\n\nStart by brainstorming a list of potential topics. Then, try to develop a catchy hook or phrase that sums up the song's main idea. Start fleshing out the lyrics once you have the hook, then use the hook as a starting point.\n\nAs you write, try to evoke a certain emotion or feeling.\n\nOnce you have the song's basic structure, go back and revise the lyrics, making sure they flow well and are easy to understand. Don't hesitate to listen to popular songs for inspiration and work on your ideas from there.\n\n## Write melodies\n\nStart by humming or singing a few different melodies until you find one you like. Then, begin with a purely instrumental and somewhat familiar melody.\n\nOnce you have a melody you like, start fleshing it out by adding chords. You don't have to reimagine musical ideas every time: start with something you know and allow some variance, make changes, and work from there.\n\n## Write chords\n\nTry to build a balance between tension and release as you add chords. Try replicating your favourite tune's major or minor chords if you're starting. Then, have fun creating variations of those well-crafted songs.\n\nOnce you have a few compelling melodies and some interesting chord progressions, go back and choose the primary and varied version of the main melody you will use (the variation is typically for the second chorus).\n\n## Run musical experiments\n\nTry new sounds, instruments, samples, and effects. At this stage, you want your creative juices to flow. It's not time to hone in on the details; it's time to create things that are boundless to limitations. Try new and different things.\n\nYou may also want to experiment with different genres.\n\nBy writing in different genres, you will be able to broaden your skillset and learn new techniques that can be applied to your own style.\n\nSome genres that you may want to try include:\n\n* Pop\n* Rock\n* R&B\n* Country\n* Hip-hop\n* EDM\n* Classic\n* Orchestral\n\nRemember, there are no rules when it comes to songwriting. Most importantly, you enjoy the process and allow your creativity to flow.\n\n# 4. Experiment with different songwriting techniques\n\nAn excellent way to improve your skills is to experiment with different techniques. There are a variety of songwriting techniques that you can use to add interest and depth to your songs. By trying new things, you will learn what works for you and what doesn't.\n\nSome techniques to try include:\n\n## Practice writing distinctive grooves\n\nA groove is a repeating musical figure that provides the foundation for a piece of music. Any combination of instruments can create it, but it is typically associated with rhythm section instruments like drums and bass.\n\nA distinctive groove can help make a song more memorable and catchy and add a sense of style and personality—something truly unique to your musical style.\n\nTo get started, try experimenting with **different rhythmic patterns** and **melodic motifs**. Also, don't be afraid to add embellishments like fills and breaks. Try adding more groove/swing to your midi patterns or vary the tempo. Maybe switch up the time signature?\n\n## Work with different harmonic and melodic ideas\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nHarmonic ideas are different progressions, borrowed chords, and modulations.\n\nMelodic ideas are different melodic shapes, motifs, and sequences of single notes.\n\nTry working with both — aim for trial and error with your instrumentation.\n\nThen switch instruments.\n\nWhat sounds best? A guitar? Piano? Synth? Drums? Bass?\n\n## Write interesting chord progressions\n\nYou can use a variety of different chords to create exciting progressions. Try using unusual chords or chords that you don't often use. You can also try creating passages that move in unexpected ways. Make it a challenge to make things funky and different.\n\nAdding engaging rhythms can make your progressions sound unique and exciting. For example, try using **different time signatures** or **adding syncopation** to your chords.\n\nAdding a melody to your chord progression can make it sound even more enjoyable. Try playing around with different melodies or even creating your own.\n\nThe best way to create interesting chord progressions is to experiment. Try different things, and see what sounds good. There are no rules, so feel free to be creative!\n\n## Write many unique melodies\n\nTry coming up with as many unique melodies as possible. Vary them as much as you can. You will force yourself to crate **quantity before quality** and then sift through those that stand out the most. Try different sounds to come up with original ideas and differentiated takes.\n\n## Change perspectives\n\nAre you not feeling inspired? Try taking on an entirely new perspective or direction for the track. For example, alternate the tempo, add or remove elements, or try a completely new genre.\n\nRemember, there are no rules when it comes to songwriting. The most important thing is that you have fun while you are creating. Let your inspiration flow and enjoy yourself.\n\n## Use effects to try a unique songwriting voice\n\nOne way to add interest and depth to your songs is to experiment with different sound effects. Effects can be used to create a unique songwriting voice and can help you stand out from the crowd. Some effects that you may want to try include:\n\n* Delay\n* Reverb\n* Flanger\n* Phaser\n* Distortion (Saturation/Overdrive)\n* Low-pass/high-pass filters\n\n## Play with words\n\nTry writing lyrics by using metaphors and similes. Use wordplay to add interest and depth to your lyrics. Try different rhyme schemes to add variety— pair unusual phrases. Finally, create a song challenge where you see things differently, in a different tone, and see the results.\n\n# 5. Write from the heart\n\nAs an artist, putting your soul into something comes from a place of honesty and sincerity. This feeling will connect with your listeners and make your songs resonate with them.\n\nHave a vision, a direction to where you want the listener to go. Think about how you want to make them feel, and then pour that into your music. Write about things that you are passionate about, and try to be as personal and honest as possible. Your goal should be to create a connection— make your listeners feel something.\n\nDon't rush— think those ideas through.\n\n## Jot lyrics on paper\n\nOne way to help you write from your heart is to physically write your lyrics down on paper. Writing on paper is preferable to typing because it's less distracting than a screen and more connected to physical elements — your hands, eyes, and soul. You can also use a thesaurus or a dictionary to help you find the perfect word to describe how you're feeling.\n\nDon't worry about editing your lyrics yet.\n\nDon't worry about making your lyrics flawless.\n\nGet all of your thoughts and draft them on paper.\n\nThe first draft of your lyrics doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to be honest.\n\n## Create lyric-oriented melodies— easy to sing and catchy\n\nYour melodies should be catchy and easy to sing. Repetition will help your listeners remember your songs and allow them to sing along with you.\n\nYour goal should be to write music that people can't get out of their heads.\n\nTry to create memorable hooks that will stay with your listeners long after they've heard your song.\n\n## Create unusual phrases that stand out from the rest\n\nPart of what makes a song memorable is its originality. Try to create phrases that stand out from the rest and make listeners take notice. Be creative with your word choice, and don't be afraid to experiment.\n\nListen to your favourite songs and analyze why they are so catchy.\n\nOne way to improve your songwriting is to listen to your favourite songs and analyze why they are so catchy. What is the melody or the lyrics that make them so memorable? How can you incorporate these elements into your own songwriting?\n\n# 6. Write lyrics that tell a story\n\nWhen working on a new song and you start writing the lyrics, consider what kind of story you want to tell. What is the song about? What is the main message that you want to get across?\n\nLyrics should stand on their own, even if someone can't hear the music.\n\nLyrics should be able to paint a picture in the listener's mind and give them a clear idea of what the song is about.\n\n## Use strong verbs to convey an emotion\n\nOne way to make your lyrics more powerful is to use strong verbs that convey emotion. Strong verbs will help your listeners feel more emotions and understand the message you're trying to get across.\n\nSome strong verbs that you can use include:\n\n* Love\n* Hate\n* Need\n* Desire\n* Crave\n\n## Use figurative language\n\nFigurative language is a great way to add depth and emotion to your lyrics. It can also paint a picture in the listener's mind and help them understand your message more clearly.\n\nSome examples of figurative language include:\n\n* Metaphors\n* Similes\n* Analogies\n* Hyperboles\n* Personification\n\n## Figure out the main message\n\nBefore you start writing your lyrics, it's important to figure out the main message that you want to get across. What is the song's theme? What are you trying to say?\n\nFlex those writing muscles and create original lyrics to layer on top of your next track with these ideas. Remember that successful songwriters rely on their ability to finish music consistently. They achieve routine writing: from idea to entire song in a few sittings and don't strive for perfectionism. They only envision completing what they started and moving forward to the next project. The more songs you finish, the better you will get, which is the invaluable skill you are developing.\n\n# 7. Connect with other songwriters\n\nOne of the best ways to improve your songwriting composition skills is to connect with other songwriters. You can learn new techniques and get feedback on your work by sharing ideas and collaborating with others. You can also gain knowledge and inspiration from others and learn more about making a good song. In addition, you will get inspired to create ideas that you probably have never thought about.\n\nHere are a few ways to connect with other songwriters:\n\n## Join a songwriting group or community\n\n[Communities](https://www.craftyoursound.com/how-to-make-a-remix-a-beginners-guide/#%E2%AD%95-communities) are a great way to meet other songwriters. Most groups meet regularly to share ideas and give feedback. It's a great way to improve inspiration and songwriting skills.\n\nNo matter how you connect with other songwriters, finding a community where you feel comfortable is essential.\n\n## Join songwriting workshops and events\n\nThese events usually feature panel discussions and workshops led by successful songwriters. Attendees can ask questions and learn about the songwriting process. These events are a great way to learn more about songwriting and get inspired by other writers. Make it a challenge to connect with at least one other songwriter.\n\n# 8. Take care of your mental health\n\nSongwriting is a complex craft. It's important to stay mentally healthy if you want to be successful. You can easily get overwhelmed or discouraged when working on a song, especially if it's not going well. Take care of yourself mentally and emotionally so you don't get burned out or discouraged.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you take care of your mental health:\n\n## Get enough sleep and exercise\n\nSleep is vital for your mental health. Make sure you're getting enough sleep to be productive and creative when you're writing. Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and boost your mood. Taking a break to go for a walk or run can help clear your mind and give you a fresh perspective on your song.\n\n## Eat healthy foods\n\nWhat you eat can impact your mental health. Eating healthy foods will help you feel better mentally and physically. Avoid processed foods and eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n\n## Take breaks often\n\nDon't try to write a song in one sitting. It's essential to take breaks to avoid getting overwhelmed or discouraged. Get up, walk around, nap, or watch a movie. Taking a break will help you come back to your song with fresh eyes.\n\n## Make time for yourself\n\nIt's important to make time for yourself outside of songwriting. Make sure you're taking care of your physical health, getting enough sleep, and spending time with friends and family. It's also important to take breaks from songwriting when you need to. Don't be afraid to step away from your work if you feel overwhelmed.\n\n## Set realistic goals\n\nIt's crucial to have realistic objectives in mind while songwriting. It's easy to become discouraged if you put too much pressure on yourself. Set modest goals for each songwriting session, and don't be afraid to pat yourself on the back when you achieve them. For example, a realistic goal can be finishing the chord progression in an hour's sitting. It can be finishing the main drop (chorus) during a two-hour block. As you noticed, a realistic goal is measurable and has a clear outcome. Once you start working this way, you will be less stressed and achieve more—these are the secrets of experienced songwriters.\n\n## Find a creative outlet\n\nIt's crucial to find a creative outlet outside of songwriting. This diversity can help you relieve stress and give you a break from the pressure of writing a song. Some creative outlets you might consider are painting, photography, or playing an instrument.\n\n## Talk to someone\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to someone about it. Talk to a friend, family member, therapist, or anyone who will listen. It can be helpful to talk about what you're going through with someone who understands. In addition, it can help you manage your anxiety and depression.\n\nBy taking care of your mental health, you'll be better positioned to write successful songs. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're struggling; take breaks.\n\n# 9. Deal with writer's block head-on\n\nMany successful songwriters learned the importance of building a creative system (engine). As a result, they don't wait for inspiration to strike. Instead, they start working through their new song by starting with a template, presets, and previous ideas and work their way through that initial hump.\n\nA **blank canvas** can be a significant **obstacle** when songwriting. It can be challenging to start a song if you're struggling to develop ideas.\n\nHere are a few tips:\n\n## Start with a template\n\nUse a songwriting template to help you get started on your song. A template can give you a structure to follow and inspire your lyrics and melodies.\n\n## Use presets\n\nIf you're struggling to come up with ideas, try using presets. Presets are pre-made chord progressions, melodies, and beats that you can use in your song. They can help you get started quickly and give you ideas to work with.\n\n## Draw inspiration\n\nIf you're having trouble coming up with ideas, try listening to other songs for inspiration. Identify what you like about the music and see if you can use it in your own song.\n\n## Set realistic expectations\n\nIt's essential to set realistic expectations for yourself when songwriting. Don't expect to write a hit song every time you sit down to write. Every songwriter makes mistakes, but the best songwriters learn from those mistakes and use them to improve their songwriting. Try taking on a songwriting challenge if you're stuck in a rut. Pick a topic or theme and write a song about it. It doesn't matter if the song is good or bad; try to get the creative juices flowing. You might be surprised at what you come up with. And who knows, you might just write your next hit song!\n\nThe more your write, the more you produce, the more mistakes you will make, and the more you need to learn from those mistakes. The only way to success is through failure.\n\n# 10. Find a creative space that works\n\nArt inspires. Art creates. Art is passion. Art is life.\n\nAs an artist, your studio is a special place; it's a space where you can let your creativity flow and feel inspired.\n\nA creative space can be a physical outlet or an online space. Finding a place where you feel comfortable and can focus on your work is important.\n\nHere are a few spaces you can try:\n\n* Home studio\n* Friend's studio\n* Coffee Shop\n* Discord (and other online spaces)\n\n# TLDR\n\nKeep a journal of ideas, get organized, practice regularly, and experiment with different techniques. You should also write from the heart, draw inspiration from personal experiences, and use lyrics to tell a story.\n\nTaking care of your mental health and dealing with writer's block head-on is also critical, as setting achievable goals for yourself.\n\nIt helps to find inspiration in various forms of art and music to help you create unique and compelling songs.\n\nFind a creative space, practice, and learn from your mistakes — start forging your journey toward becoming a successful songwriter and music producer.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to ask for help if you're struggling. Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nThanks for reading — if you found this post remotely interesting and/or valuable— [I write about music production, songwriting, productivity and more here](http://www.craftyoursound.com/).\n\nHere's a link to the [free newsletter](https://www.craftyoursound.com/newsletter/) where we share actionable tips, practical advice, and other know-hacks to help you level up.\n\nCheers!",

The struggle to get started. The lack of inspiration. And as a result, the feeling of absent originality when creating ideas.\n\nYou might know **where to start** but **not how to finish** a track. You might also struggle with an artistic block or feel unmotivated to write – like nothing sounds or feels good enough.\n\nI will share and explain the things I've put in place that helped me overcome writer's block with any song, music or video production.\n\nI apologize for the length. I just wanted to share all my ideas with you to then pick and choose what works best for you, and hope you never have a problem sitting down to produce or write a song again. Bear in mind that some sections apply more to writing lyrics than to writing instrumentals.\n\n# 1. Keep a journal of ideas via playlists and bookmarks\n\nOne of the best ways to overcome writer's block is to keep a journal of ideas. Journaling ideas can be done in a few ways: ** 1 ** **creating playlists of songs that inspire you**, ** 2  bookmarking relevant websites,** and ** 3  saving articles with songwriting tips**. These methods will help you stay organized and motivated and help you find inspiration when you need it.\n\nHere are some things you need to ask yourself when journaling:\n\n## What interests you?\n\nYou can find inspiration from interests by exploring music scores, genres, styles, and eras, looking at artwork, and reading poetry. You can also find inspiration by spending time in nature and talking to other songwriters. Exploring different mediums allows you to find new and exciting ways to be inspired and produce unique and compelling songs.\n\n## Who are your favourite artists?\n\nInspiration for musical ideas comes from listening to your favourite musicians and music producers. Examining their music can help you get in the right frame of mind to write your songs and give you ideas for new melodies or chords. You can also learn a lot about songwriting by studying your favourite artists' musical styles and various works.\n\n## What are important personal experiences?\n\nThese can be happy or sad memories, moments that made you laugh or cry, or events that changed your life. When you write about personal experiences, you can connect with your listeners on a deeper level, and they will be able to relate to your songs more easily. Additionally, writing from the heart can help you write more honest and emotionally powerful songs. Your life experiences will give you a wealth of material to write about.\n\n## What are you passionate about? What drives you?\n\nYour passion is what will make your songs unique and compelling. When you write about passionate topics, your enthusiasm will shine through your music, connecting with your listeners. By writing about things that matter to you, you can produce songs that have the power to inspire and motivate others.\n\n## What genres of music do you enjoy listening to?\n\nBy exploring different genres of music, you can find new and exciting ideas to incorporate into your own songs. You can also better understand how other musical elements work together to create a specific sound or mood. Also, listening to different music can help you expand your musical vocabulary and develop your unique style.\n\n## What other art forms do you enjoy?\n\nLike music, other art forms can also be a source of inspiration for your songwriting. By exploring different types of art, you can find new ways to express yourself and create original and innovative songs. For example, studying other art forms can help you better understand using music to convey emotion and create a specific mood. Try this as a songwriting challenge: replicate a different style of music/song than the genre you're comfortable with.\n\n# 2. Get organized and develop an action plan\n\nYou have to get organized.\n\nAnd I don't mean only organizing your sound sample packs or your project tracks. I mean organize your life, day, and tasks.\n\nOrganization starts with ** 1 ** **creating an action plan** and **setting achievable goals**. Having a clear goal in mind will make you more motivated and likely to achieve your target. Additionally, by ** 2 ** **setting deadlines** for yourself, you will be less likely to procrastinate and more likely to stay on track. Finally, ** 3 ** **developing a routine** and **sticking to it**. Set aside time each day to write and make sure that you stick to your schedule.\n\n## Create a Songwriting/Production Schedule\n\nSet realistic goals, and make sure that you allocate enough time to achieve them.\n\nStart by setting a goal of writing one song per week. If you cannot write a complete song in one sitting, break it down into smaller goals.\n\nFor example, you could set a goal of writing the lyrics for one song per week and the melody for another.\n\nOnce you have completed a few songs, you can increase the frequency and quantity of your output.\n\nSet yourself a songwriting challenge at least once a month and see how it goes— the results will surprise you.\n\n## Establish Goals\n\nWhen starting a new song, having specific and achievable goals is essential.\n\nSome examples of specific goals include:\n\n* Write a song with a minimum of four chords\n* Write a song in the key of C major or A minor\n* Write a song with a verse and chorus\n* Write a song that is under three minutes in length\n\nAchieving these goals will help improve your songwriting skills and technique and give you a sense of accomplishment.\n\n## Find Inspiration\n\nOne of the best ways to find inspiration for your songwriting is to listen to music. In addition, you can get new ideas and learn about different musical styles by listening to other music.\n\nIn addition to listening to music, you can also find inspiration in other art forms, such as painting, dance, or film. Another great way to find inspiration is simply taking a walk and allowing your mind to wander.\n\nSometimes, the best ideas come when you least expect them.\n\n## Develop a Style\n\nOne of the best ways to develop your musical style is to listen to a wide variety of music: the more songs, the better. And sometimes, you have to **listen** to and **study music** outside your comfort zone.\n\nAs you listen, pay attention to the different **elements** of each song.\n\nSome things to consider include:\n\n* Overall mood or feeling\n* Instruments\n* Tempo\n* Melody\n* Lyrics\n* Rhythm\n* Harmony\n\nBy understanding how these elements fit and work together, you can start to develop your style. Also, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. The more you experiment, the more you will learn about what works for you and what doesn't – keep sharpening your songwriting composition skills.\n\n# 3. Practice, practice, practice\n\nThe best way to improve any skill is to practice every day. By committing to writing and producing regularly, you will quickly see results.\n\n**Results create momentum**. And momentum gives you the necessary energy and motivation to drive through pain and grow.\n\nYou should practice a set of the following skills **every** single day:\n\n## Write lyrics\n\nStart by brainstorming a list of potential topics. Then, try to develop a catchy hook or phrase that sums up the song's main idea. Start fleshing out the lyrics once you have the hook, then use the hook as a starting point.\n\nAs you write, try to evoke a certain emotion or feeling.\n\nOnce you have the song's basic structure, go back and revise the lyrics, making sure they flow well and are easy to understand. Don't hesitate to listen to popular songs for inspiration and work on your ideas from there.\n\n## Write melodies\n\nStart by humming or singing a few different melodies until you find one you like. Then, begin with a purely instrumental and somewhat familiar melody.\n\nOnce you have a melody you like, start fleshing it out by adding chords. You don't have to reimagine musical ideas every time: start with something you know and allow some variance, make changes, and work from there.\n\n## Write chords\n\nTry to build a balance between tension and release as you add chords. Try replicating your favourite tune's major or minor chords if you're starting. Then, have fun creating variations of those well-crafted songs.\n\nOnce you have a few compelling melodies and some interesting chord progressions, go back and choose the primary and varied version of the main melody you will use  the variation is typically for the second chorus .\n\n## Run musical experiments\n\nTry new sounds, instruments, samples, and effects. At this stage, you want your creative juices to flow. It's not time to hone in on the details; it's time to create things that are boundless to limitations. Try new and different things.\n\nYou may also want to experiment with different genres.\n\nBy writing in different genres, you will be able to broaden your skillset and learn new techniques that can be applied to your own style.\n\nSome genres that you may want to try include:\n\n* Pop\n* Rock\n* R&B\n* Country\n* Hip-hop\n* EDM\n* Classic\n* Orchestral\n\nRemember, there are no rules when it comes to songwriting. Most importantly, you enjoy the process and allow your creativity to flow.\n\n# 4. Experiment with different songwriting techniques\n\nAn excellent way to improve your skills is to experiment with different techniques. There are a variety of songwriting techniques that you can use to add interest and depth to your songs. By trying new things, you will learn what works for you and what doesn't.\n\nSome techniques to try include:\n\n## Practice writing distinctive grooves\n\nA groove is a repeating musical figure that provides the foundation for a piece of music. Any combination of instruments can create it, but it is typically associated with rhythm section instruments like drums and bass.\n\nA distinctive groove can help make a song more memorable and catchy and add a sense of style and personality—something truly unique to your musical style.\n\nTo get started, try experimenting with **different rhythmic patterns** and **melodic motifs**. Also, don't be afraid to add embellishments like fills and breaks. Try adding more groove/swing to your midi patterns or vary the tempo. Maybe switch up the time signature?\n\n## Work with different harmonic and melodic ideas\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nHarmonic ideas are different progressions, borrowed chords, and modulations.\n\nMelodic ideas are different melodic shapes, motifs, and sequences of single notes.\n\nTry working with both — aim for trial and error with your instrumentation.\n\nThen switch instruments.\n\nWhat sounds best? A guitar? Piano? Synth? Drums? Bass?\n\n## Write interesting chord progressions\n\nYou can use a variety of different chords to create exciting progressions. Try using unusual chords or chords that you don't often use. You can also try creating passages that move in unexpected ways. Make it a challenge to make things funky and different.\n\nAdding engaging rhythms can make your progressions sound unique and exciting. For example, try using **different time signatures** or **adding syncopation** to your chords.\n\nAdding a melody to your chord progression can make it sound even more enjoyable. Try playing around with different melodies or even creating your own.\n\nThe best way to create interesting chord progressions is to experiment. Try different things, and see what sounds good. There are no rules, so feel free to be creative!\n\n## Write many unique melodies\n\nTry coming up with as many unique melodies as possible. Vary them as much as you can. You will force yourself to crate **quantity before quality** and then sift through those that stand out the most. Try different sounds to come up with original ideas and differentiated takes.\n\n## Change perspectives\n\nAre you not feeling inspired? Try taking on an entirely new perspective or direction for the track. For example, alternate the tempo, add or remove elements, or try a completely new genre.\n\nRemember, there are no rules when it comes to songwriting. The most important thing is that you have fun while you are creating. Let your inspiration flow and enjoy yourself.\n\n## Use effects to try a unique songwriting voice\n\nOne way to add interest and depth to your songs is to experiment with different sound effects. Effects can be used to create a unique songwriting voice and can help you stand out from the crowd. Some effects that you may want to try include:\n\n* Delay\n* Reverb\n* Flanger\n* Phaser\n* Distortion  Saturation/Overdrive \n* Low-pass/high-pass filters\n\n## Play with words\n\nTry writing lyrics by using metaphors and similes. Use wordplay to add interest and depth to your lyrics. Try different rhyme schemes to add variety— pair unusual phrases. Finally, create a song challenge where you see things differently, in a different tone, and see the results.\n\n# 5. Write from the heart\n\nAs an artist, putting your soul into something comes from a place of honesty and sincerity. This feeling will connect with your listeners and make your songs resonate with them.\n\nHave a vision, a direction to where you want the listener to go. Think about how you want to make them feel, and then pour that into your music. Write about things that you are passionate about, and try to be as personal and honest as possible. Your goal should be to create a connection— make your listeners feel something.\n\nDon't rush— think those ideas through.\n\n## Jot lyrics on paper\n\nOne way to help you write from your heart is to physically write your lyrics down on paper. Writing on paper is preferable to typing because it's less distracting than a screen and more connected to physical elements — your hands, eyes, and soul. You can also use a thesaurus or a dictionary to help you find the perfect word to describe how you're feeling.\n\nDon't worry about editing your lyrics yet.\n\nDon't worry about making your lyrics flawless.\n\nGet all of your thoughts and draft them on paper.\n\nThe first draft of your lyrics doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to be honest.\n\n## Create lyric-oriented melodies— easy to sing and catchy\n\nYour melodies should be catchy and easy to sing. Repetition will help your listeners remember your songs and allow them to sing along with you.\n\nYour goal should be to write music that people can't get out of their heads.\n\nTry to create memorable hooks that will stay with your listeners long after they've heard your song.\n\n## Create unusual phrases that stand out from the rest\n\nPart of what makes a song memorable is its originality. Try to create phrases that stand out from the rest and make listeners take notice. Be creative with your word choice, and don't be afraid to experiment.\n\nListen to your favourite songs and analyze why they are so catchy.\n\nOne way to improve your songwriting is to listen to your favourite songs and analyze why they are so catchy. What is the melody or the lyrics that make them so memorable? How can you incorporate these elements into your own songwriting?\n\n# 6. Write lyrics that tell a story\n\nWhen working on a new song and you start writing the lyrics, consider what kind of story you want to tell. What is the song about? What is the main message that you want to get across?\n\nLyrics should stand on their own, even if someone can't hear the music.\n\nLyrics should be able to paint a picture in the listener's mind and give them a clear idea of what the song is about.\n\n## Use strong verbs to convey an emotion\n\nOne way to make your lyrics more powerful is to use strong verbs that convey emotion. Strong verbs will help your listeners feel more emotions and understand the message you're trying to get across.\n\nSome strong verbs that you can use include:\n\n* Love\n* Hate\n* Need\n* Desire\n* Crave\n\n## Use figurative language\n\nFigurative language is a great way to add depth and emotion to your lyrics. It can also paint a picture in the listener's mind and help them understand your message more clearly.\n\nSome examples of figurative language include:\n\n* Metaphors\n* Similes\n* Analogies\n* Hyperboles\n* Personification\n\n## Figure out the main message\n\nBefore you start writing your lyrics, it's important to figure out the main message that you want to get across. What is the song's theme? What are you trying to say?\n\nFlex those writing muscles and create original lyrics to layer on top of your next track with these ideas. Remember that successful songwriters rely on their ability to finish music consistently. They achieve routine writing: from idea to entire song in a few sittings and don't strive for perfectionism. They only envision completing what they started and moving forward to the next project. The more songs you finish, the better you will get, which is the invaluable skill you are developing.\n\n# 7.

You should also write from the heart, draw inspiration from personal experiences, and use lyrics to tell a story.\n\nTaking care of your mental health and dealing with writer's block head-on is also critical, as setting achievable goals for yourself.\n\nIt helps to find inspiration in various forms of art and music to help you create unique and compelling songs.\n\nFind a creative space, practice, and learn from your mistakes — start forging your journey toward becoming a successful songwriter and music producer.\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to ask for help if you're struggling. Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nThanks for reading — if you found this post remotely interesting and/or valuable—  I write about music production, songwriting, productivity and more here  http://www.craftyoursound.com/ .\n\nHere's a link to the  free newsletter  https://www.craftyoursound.com/newsletter/  where we share actionable tips, practical advice, and other know-hacks to help you level up.\n\nCheers! https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/xzm7vm/how_to_overcome_writers_block_when_writing_music/",

My childhood friend's father is a music producer for mainly Christian Rock artists. After a few years knowing them, they soon had to move to Tennessee to limit the amount of travel he had been doing previously. I watched him work a lot of them time, but being only about 10 or 11 I didn't really retain any information for it. In highschool I was a sound technician for the Theatre department so I got a small amount of knowledge on how to basically work one, but only the basics. \n\nI have since been going to the local community college and have only learned a small amount of schooling in music production. Unfortunately, the largest set back for me was recently being diagnosed Schizoaffective ( for those who don't know of the disorder, it's a form of depression that when stressed out gives me audio and visual hallucinations ). This has made it very difficult to get much of any of my work finished and therefor have had to drop out of school due to my illness. Currently I have no job and I'm not enrolled in school anymore. What I really want to do is try and learn how to produce my own music, but I just don't really know where to start. Despite this disorder, I have decided that I won't let it hold me back, and I will push forward because this is honestly what I want to do with the rest of my life!\n\nI was hoping that someone on this sub-reddit could help me and direct me in the right direction.

   "body": "Hey guys-\n\nHope all is well. I’ve been busy reading up on music theory…specially harmony and I’m running into a roadblock. Case and point: Harmony for Computer Musicians, and a several other Michael Hewitt books, cover i-iv-v-I progressions for a minor key (let’s use A minor for simplicity sake). Playing this chord progression in a closed position sounds boring and over dramatic. \n\nBuilding upon that, if I then take said chord progression, give it four voices (i: [A1-C3-E3-A3], iv: [D2-D3-F3-A3], v: [E2-B2-E3-G3], i: [A1-C3-E3-A3]), according to him it has proper voice leading. Said voice leading, from what I’ve read about it, is appropriate since each register has its own melody. You basically go, motion-wise, from initial to oblique, to contrary, to contrary. \n\nYet when I play this on any patch (I mostly use Sylenth1), it sounds A. muddy, B. depressing, C. unlike most electronic music I’ve listened to excluding pads. I’m also sure this is a common chord progression and that I’m doing something wrong since it’s in a ton of songs.\nSo from here I consult YouTube and I find a video like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-BEVJlRMpI (Note: I have no interest in sounding like deadmau5. Just looking for inspiration. I’d take Underworld any day). This guy is obviously using a different progression than the one mentioned above, but he’s still playing simple triads. \nFrom what I can tell, for the most part he’s either putting the third in the highest register or playing power chords. He then throws a really simple binary melody over the top. To me, this, ostensibly, sounds pretty good. He’s also only using one patch. And this pretty much flies in the face of a lot of the stuff Hewitt is writing about, as well as most of my theory books. I also have a few Abletunes templates which do similar stuff to this guy and I can’t reconcile it against any of the stuff I have been reading.\n\nSo to cut to the chase, can someone tell me what I’m doing wrong? Should I space my chords out more than I am already doing? If at all possible, I’d like something grounded in theory so I can reference it as I compose. I appreciate the whole play by ear thing, but I like to have some logic/theory to fall back on. I feel more comfortable being grounded in a tangible reference point.\n\nIf it helps, I’ve read Music Theory for Computer Musicians, Harmony for Computer Musicians, Snowman’s Dance Music Manual, MusicTheory.net, and a few more. Also I've written more than the chord progression I mentioned in the above, but again, I keep getting this crappy muddy sound.\n",

   "body": "Sup everyone reading this, it took me ages to finally post this on here so thanks for taking the time & patience to read this, I tried to keep it as short as possible, but fill you in as much as I could. \n\nLet me give you a quick introduction of myself.   I've been making music since 94 playing the drums and then moving to electronic music for multiple reasons, mainly the bass player in the band quit and went to college (we just made a demo and was on the radio was the high point) and I could no longer keep up on the drums anymore. The reason is I have muscular dystrophy, type SMA3 is the closest thing they can pinpoint it too for now.   The main symptoms I have from Muscular Dystrophy are listed here if your interested http://mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy/signs-and-symptoms but basically I am weak as hell, I can barely raise my hands in the air, and Steve Urkel looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger in my eyes as far as strength goes. So you won't be seeing me DJ with my hands up in the air or hand pumping much. (maybe that's a good thing?)  I feel like since I have Muscular Dystrophy that time is always against me.  My chronic back pain gets worse and worse, more health problems arise by the day and me being a perfectionist doesn't help me out at all.    \n\n As far as being in a band I didn't want to count on anyone anymore but myself, since in a band people have to be just as passionate as everyone else if they are to be successful.  Counting on them to come to practice,shows, will they show up? Will they quit tomorrow because we didn't agree on something?  \n\nSince 1997 I moved out with some friends and I've been producing on my own, playing Live P.A. with samplers and grooveboxes, it was great!  I was starting to meet other producers and Dj's and to see all the styles everyone had and eventually hanging out and trading ideas off one another. I did the Live P.A. thing until I finally got a computer in 2000 and got Reason and started producing, but in 2002 I stopped walking.   My leg muscles couldn't hold my ass up some days and other days I could walk with a cane, but during this time my lease was up and had to make a choice; try and find a place on my own or move home.   I couldn't walk anymore, my lease was up, my tail was between my legs and head down very low, so I called up my parents and asked to come home. \n\nNot being able to walk depressed the hell out of me, and even to this day I'm still not used to it. (still have dreams where I walk)  The biggest problem I have now is my parents live pretty much in the country, no sidewalks, no stores for miles.   I don't have a car/van with a ramp so I'm basically STUCK in my house.   The only time I get out of the house is to go to a doctor appointment, or if one of my friends that are physically able to transfer me into their car & grab my manual wheelchair to go somewhere, but basically we just hang out here.       I also live in the midwest so basically 6 months out of the year I'm REALLY stuck in the house with the cold weather and snow/ice, makes it very hard to get out of the house, let alone staying SANE!   Cabin Fever happens all the time with me and it's a struggle staying positive but I try my best with the resources I have.  Another big thing driving me insane is living with parents!  I love them to death, but I can't really be myself here and do what I really want to do.    I'm at heart a very sociable person, but being stuck at home 90% of the time, puts a big damper on meeting new people, women, socializing, just getting the hell outta doge!\n\nI plan on finally moving out of the midwest with some friends to Cali to pursue my career there, sometime in January, so trying to save every cent I can for the big move.   I'm really going to miss my family & friends mostly, but I must do this and get out of my comfort zone.       \n  \n\nIF YOU PRODUCE MUSIC YOU NEED TO FEED OFF OF EACH OTHER.  And that is one thing I don't have anymore and the MAIN REASON I'm writing this. I think it's very important for producers to feed off of each others energy, that's how you stay on point and grow as a producer. I would love to have someone to look up too.  To have other producers in the game that you respect is very very important I think.  It allows you to bounce off ideas, or get feedback on your music and just a different perspective on what your seeing from another producer.   When I did have other producers to talk too, I did feel my production improved dramatically.  I would hear their track, and if it sounded sick I would let them know, \"man this is some sick shit, what have you done, what the hell did you eat and drink that day?!?!\"  Because that would make me inspired to go home and make some music of my own. The way you set your EQ's to the way you chop your samples, each producer does it in their own unique way.  Your Beats definitely show your personality, when you start hearing producers music you can tell by the style who it is usually because it defines that producer.  \n\nSo I'm asking all you producers out there that are interested in doing this that lives in the Milwaukee/Chicago area or Online, feel free to hit me up on here or email me @druminfected@gmail.com Twitter: Druminfected and we can get this \"Feed Off Each Other\" Group started!   I've done plenty of Live streams in the past & even do a live gaming stream on twitch.tv for years, so making a live stream for our group after everything gets sorted would be easy to do as well.     Then we could even have a day of the week to all hang out on the live stream/chat and listen to all our tracks and give advice, meet each other and most importantly FEED OFF EACH OTHER!   By the way, the DAW's I use are Ableton and Reason but for this group it doesn't matter what DAW,VST, Keyboard, it's not what you have it's how you use it!\n\nMuch appreciated if you just took the time to read all of this, I would upvote you just on doing that.    Thanks again everyone.\n\n\n\n",

I've been making music since 94 playing the drums and then moving to electronic music for multiple reasons, mainly the bass player in the band quit and went to college  we just made a demo and was on the radio was the high point  and I could no longer keep up on the drums anymore. The reason is I have muscular dystrophy, type SMA3 is the closest thing they can pinpoint it too for now.   The main symptoms I have from Muscular Dystrophy are listed here if your interested http://mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy/signs-and-symptoms but basically I am weak as hell, I can barely raise my hands in the air, and Steve Urkel looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger in my eyes as far as strength goes. So you won't be seeing me DJ with my hands up in the air or hand pumping much.  maybe that's a good thing?   I feel like since I have Muscular Dystrophy that time is always against me.  My chronic back pain gets worse and worse, more health problems arise by the day and me being a perfectionist doesn't help me out at all.    \n\n As far as being in a band I didn't want to count on anyone anymore but myself, since in a band people have to be just as passionate as everyone else if they are to be successful.  Counting on them to come to practice,shows, will they show up? Will they quit tomorrow because we didn't agree on something?  \n\nSince 1997 I moved out with some friends and I've been producing on my own, playing Live P.A. with samplers and grooveboxes, it was great!  I was starting to meet other producers and Dj's and to see all the styles everyone had and eventually hanging out and trading ideas off one another. I did the Live P.A. thing until I finally got a computer in 2000 and got Reason and started producing, but in 2002 I stopped walking.

   "body": "I apologize in advance. This is going to be a friggin novel.\n\nThis is actually the second time I’m writing this post. It got taken down the first time since I posted a link. I’m new to reddit (not new new, just this is my first post), but did, infact, read the rules before posting. I respect the fact that subreddits have rules, I just thought posting a link to one of my songs as an example of the problem I’m having was a good enough reason to, but now I know it isn’t and I won’t do it again, even though it would probably help whoever might have an answer to my problem to get a better grasp on the specifics, but I can live with it. If you think you could help me after reading this and want a tangible example of the problem, plz message me.\n\n(This first part is kind of just a little bio about myself so if you don’t care about my life story just skip down to the asterisks for the actual discussion of my problem)\n\nI have been self-learning producing for over 4 years now, and I’ve become so obsessed with it that I want to absolutely perfect everything possible on the technical side of things before I focus more on the creative and actually release anything as an artist. I want to have the ability to execute my ideas the exact way I want them to be before I start really putting effort into it and I know that I can get to that point since my whole life I’ve been a tech wizard. People always ask me questions about random things having to do with technology and I almost always know something about it or give them my best guess and very few times am I far off.\n\nI went to school for 3.5 years as a nuclear engineer major and decided I hated it and wanted more out of life than a mind melting career in a STEM industry. I basically slowly drifted from studying to producing during my free time until it was basically the only thing I did, which came to a breaking point where I pretty much purposefully started blowing off my college classes, because I would rather throw everything I have at what I really want while I’m young and then fail, than never even try to break free from this terrifyingly boring life plan that all of us are expected to settle with. I dropped out to pursue music and avoid getting stuck with a degree that I would feel obligated to use, then eventually become trapped, depressed, and full of regret. I have a decent job lined up at an electronics/robotics company that I plan to grind for a few years, save up for more high end music equipment, upgrade my computer, build a professionally effective home studio, and in the mean time continue to work on my creative process. But enough about my life, sorry if that was too much, I kinda just don’t have anyone who’s into producing that I can talk to so I kinda just unloaded lol. \n\n****\n\nI’m not a beginner. I know my way around a DAW really well (I use FL studio but plan to switch to Ableton at some point), and I’ve already had multiple people pay me to mix and master their stuff for them. That being said, I’m not ruling out the possibility of the mix being the essential problem, because I’m always second guessing myself, making sure there’s nothing I’m doing that’s hindering the quality of my work, but there has been multiple times (but not too many) where I feel like I got it right, and on the technical side of things, they held up pretty well when compared to professional tracks. So please, if you are barely into this learning process, (less than 2 years) don’t get cocky and try to tell me this is an easy thing to figure out, because I’m trying to reach the people who want to be (or already are) something other than mainstream SoundCloud bots who copy every YouTube tutorial by some absolute poser with click bait thumbnails and just recreate a marshmello or Martin garrix electro house track, then spam every social media and inbox they can fit their link into, and call themselves original. But if you are only a little but into your journey learning how to produce, my only advice that I could give you that I know it absolutely credible, is don’t automatically believe everything someone tells you, the only true way to get to the point you want to be is trial and error. That’s literally it. Just years and years of it. \n\nAnyway onto the problem. Very rarely do I export a master that sounds perfect when it comes to the stereo separation(well at least in my opinion, some of my non-producer friends will tell me it sounds perfect, but all of you guys know that we always notice things they don’t). It seems like I can’t line up the frequencies the right way to get the width and space I want. You know how in professional songs you can kind of like clearly hear the exact location of each sound and it sounds really natural? Well, I kind of get this weird audio blurriness(?) effect. I’m pretty sure it has something to do mastering, since sometimes my mixes sound more clear than the master. \n\nI know a lot of people are going to say “use your ears” but this is a problem I have been having for a long time(close to a year, maybe longer) and it’s only now that I’ve finally turned to the Internet for help since it is basically the last significant technical issue I have, except maybe super advanced sound design. I know that there is no perfect recipe to get a perfect stereo shape for any given mix, since mixes can be drastically different, but there has to be some kind of method to the madness.\n\nAlso to be clear - my masters don’t sound bad at all, it’s just it feels like I can’t get the stereo separation quality just the way I want it, so it’s just so frustrating. I want it be 10/10 on the clarity scale, but I’m stuck around an 8-9/10.\n\nOzone 9 update added Velvet Noise as an option that you can use as opposed to Haas. I’ve done some research on velvet noise and it seems more promising than Haas when it comes to mono compatibility, but the problem is that the way it effects the width (in magnitude and other ways) is noticeably different than Haas from Ozone 8 (which I’ve been using for a long time so I’m a little lost). Has anyone found velvet noise to be considerably better in any way?\n\nI have a few theories on what I think the problem is:\n1) just plain old ear fatigue after spending multiple attempts hours at a time making slight changes on every parameter of the imager. As well as having no real strategy as to where to begin.\n2) some plugin in my master chain before Ozone is glitching/causing problems with the stereo shape which is makes it harder when I get to the imager.\n3) I’ve been told to put the imager as the last module (before the maximizer) on ozone. (Is that wrong?)\n4) {least likely} something in the way I mix is the problem. (I maybe use too many high passes instead of low shelves which is causing phase issues?)\n5. I’m making too drastic of changes on the imager. (Some videos show guys going as far as like 50-60% on the high end slider, but whenever I do that I can’t get any of the rest of it to sound right)\n\nHere are my main questions:\n\n1) is it always a good idea to use all 4 bands in the imager?\n2) for the band separators, is the learn algorithm trust worthy? Is there another strategy I could implement to check it?\n3) is 6.0ms a standard of some kind? Are there situations where it’s a good idea to lower it or higher it? [NOTE: Sometimes it will sound good(but in different ways if that makes sense?) in various locations on this slider.\n4) are there any parameter values for anything on the imager that it is ALWAYS a bad idea to go above/below?\n5) sometimes I put the high mid slider below both the high end and low mid slider for more clarity and less harshness. Does this only work in certain situations? (Sometimes it ends up having a negative effect)\n6) I usually mono the low end frequencies(20-75ish Hz) of my kicks/subs/certain low synths IN THE MIX, so that I can play with the low end slider in the master imager in order to make sure the song doesn’t sound flat/thin. Can this cause problems?\n7) are mid/side EQs a good idea on masters? Does this help with stereo separation or hinder it? Also what are some common elements that usually benefit from a mid/side EQ? (This is a realm I haven’t explored too often)\n8) how large of a difference between band slider values is too large? (I’ve heard and seen a lot of conflicting theories on this one)\n\nSome closing notes:\n1) I make what I guess you could call electronic, and maybe the fact is that this is just something I have to figure out on own since I like to use unique sounds in different ways so that it doesn’t sound mainstream (I want my music to be noticeably different while at the same time familiar and appealing to the masses -> HUGE FLUME FAN) and most of the advice on the internet is bias toward mainstream EDM or just really situational and overall not consistent.\n2) I have really nice production headphones so that is definitely not the problem.\n3) My usual master chain that I’ve changed and added to over the years (plz critique if you notice any potential issues):\n - EQ (To cut unused frequencies at top and bottom of spectrum)\n - tape machine (for slight saturation and warmth)\n - multi band compression (I use Maximus, and have started to mess around with the saturation feature to soft clip the highs, I’m not sure yet if this is making the highs less harsh without sacrificing dynamics like I want it to do or if it’s causing all sorts of problems)\n - sometimes I use Gulfoss which is an algorithm-based dynamic EQ-type plugin\n - compressor with a mix glue preset (which I tweak)\n - De-esser (usually very low dry/wet ratio, just to take away a little bit of the unwanted noise/harshness)\n - sometimes a soft clipper (I check to make sure if this helps with getting the desired loudness or just ends up creating too much unwanted distortion or takes away from dynamics)\n - Ozone 9\n    1) tape saturation (usually around 0.5-1db gain, then I mess around with the tone and low end and high end sliders)\n    2) EQ (if the helper makes crazy changes on low end or high end i usually take it off since it’s probably because of the first EQ cuts)\n    3) dynamic EQ (the helper usually does a decent job, and the new features on Ozone 9 make it a lot easier and faster to make sure the dynamics are where they are supposed to be and the magnitudes are not too ridiculous)\n    4) vintage limiter (tube most of the time)\n    5) imager*\n    6) maximizer (usually IRC 3 or 4, I’ve started to push it a little more to get the loudness I want and it seems to be working but I’m also not sure how to configure the stereo options for the transient and sustain sliders, like whether or not they should be linked or not in different situations)\n\nI’ve messed around with the exciter a few times and usually I only have good results with the low end but with the mids it usually doesn’t add anything noteworthy and I think through out the whole master chain I do too much to the high end for it to be possible for the exciter to do anything but cause unwanted distortion and harshness. I also will use the vintage compressor on occasion, just because sometimes I need to target certain areas that Maximus wasn’t able to.\n\nWell if you actually end up reading all of this THANK YOU and I appreciate it a lot! It’s just a very specific and complicated problem that I’m not sure many ppl have run into and I have been struggling with and getting extremely frustrated over it for a while. Even if you can only maybe answer one of these many questions or have any kind of educated guess please don’t hesitate to comment. I’ve gotten to this point on my own, but at some point in a producers life he’s gonna have to ask for help, it’s inevitable. \n\ngood luck to you all and your individual projects as well! Happy Memorial Day!\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for commenting, and again I apologize for the length of the post (lmao) I was on a really long car ride and on adderall so I guess you could say I was pretty focused on getting my point across. \n\nAfter reading the comments I really think you guys are right. I've kind of been leaning on mastering and expecting it to give me more drastic results than it should/is capable of doing. I need to focus more on individually imaging stuff that needs tweaking in the mix, stop overworking myself on the imager on the master, and make sure my panning is wide enough in the mix to give the elements the space they need. I haven't mastered a song since before I posted but when I do I'm sure I'll at least get some kind of an improvement. Thanks again, I'm starting to get more involved with Reddit and I really like it, especially this subreddit. Everyone is really understanding and considerate :)",

Sometimes it ends up having a negative effect \n6  I usually mono the low end frequencies 20-75ish Hz  of my kicks/subs/certain low synths IN THE MIX, so that I can play with the low end slider in the master imager in order to make sure the song doesn’t sound flat/thin. Can this cause problems?\n7  are mid/side EQs a good idea on masters? Does this help with stereo separation or hinder it? Also what are some common elements that usually benefit from a mid/side EQ?  This is a realm I haven’t explored too often \n8  how large of a difference between band slider values is too large?  I’ve heard and seen a lot of conflicting theories on this one \n\nSome closing notes:\n1  I make what I guess you could call electronic, and maybe the fact is that this is just something I have to figure out on own since I like to use unique sounds in different ways so that it doesn’t sound mainstream  I want my music to be noticeably different while at the same time familiar and appealing to the masses -> HUGE FLUME FAN  and most of the advice on the internet is bias toward mainstream EDM or just really situational and overall not consistent.\n2  I have really nice production headphones so that is definitely not the problem.\n3  My usual master chain that I’ve changed and added to over the years  plz critique if you notice any potential issues :\n - EQ  To cut unused frequencies at top and bottom of spectrum \n - tape machine  for slight saturation and warmth \n - multi band compression  I use Maximus, and have started to mess around with the saturation feature to soft clip the highs, I’m not sure yet if this is making the highs less harsh without sacrificing dynamics like I want it to do or if it’s causing all sorts of problems \n - sometimes I use Gulfoss which is an algorithm-based dynamic EQ-type plugin\n - compressor with a mix glue preset  which I tweak \n - De-esser  usually very low dry/wet ratio, just to take away a little bit of the unwanted noise/harshness \n - sometimes a soft clipper  I check to make sure if this helps with getting the desired loudness or just ends up creating too much unwanted distortion or takes away from dynamics \n - Ozone 9\n    1  tape saturation  usually around 0.5-1db gain, then I mess around with the tone and low end and high end sliders \n    2  EQ  if the helper makes crazy changes on low end or high end i usually take it off since it’s probably because of the first EQ cuts \n    3  dynamic EQ  the helper usually does a decent job, and the new features on Ozone 9 make it a lot easier and faster to make sure the dynamics are where they are supposed to be and the magnitudes are not too ridiculous \n    4  vintage limiter  tube most of the time \n    5  imager*\n    6  maximizer  usually IRC 3 or 4, I’ve started to push it a little more to get the loudness I want and it seems to be working but I’m also not sure how to configure the stereo options for the transient and sustain sliders, like whether or not they should be linked or not in different situations \n\nI’ve messed around with the exciter a few times and usually I only have good results with the low end but with the mids it usually doesn’t add anything noteworthy and I think through out the whole master chain I do too much to the high end for it to be possible for the exciter to do anything but cause unwanted distortion and harshness. I also will use the vintage compressor on occasion, just because sometimes I need to target certain areas that Maximus wasn’t able to.\n\nWell if you actually end up reading all of this THANK YOU and I appreciate it a lot! It’s just a very specific and complicated problem that I’m not sure many ppl have run into and I have been struggling with and getting extremely frustrated over it for a while. Even if you can only maybe answer one of these many questions or have any kind of educated guess please don’t hesitate to comment. I’ve gotten to this point on my own, but at some point in a producers life he’s gonna have to ask for help, it’s inevitable. \n\ngood luck to you all and your individual projects as well! Happy Memorial Day!\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for commenting, and again I apologize for the length of the post  lmao  I was on a really long car ride and on adderall so I guess you could say I was pretty focused on getting my point across. \n\nAfter reading the comments I really think you guys are right. I've kind of been leaning on mastering and expecting it to give me more drastic results than it should/is capable of doing. I need to focus more on individually imaging stuff that needs tweaking in the mix, stop overworking myself on the imager on the master, and make sure my panning is wide enough in the mix to give the elements the space they need. I haven't mastered a song since before I posted but when I do I'm sure I'll at least get some kind of an improvement. Thanks again, I'm starting to get more involved with Reddit and I really like it, especially this subreddit.

I live with my parents, I'm in my last year of high school and I work part-time at fucking McDonalds because I don't want to depend on my parents' money. I don't know what I'm going to do after high school. At least I want to move on my own, but I can't see how that's possible if I can't get a good-paying job because of my socialization problems. I don't know. I am considering suicide, but something just keeps me from it, I guess I still find pleasure in little things: music, movies, games, and even with these little pleasures, every day ends with sad music and tears because I don't know what to do. My parents raised me a Christian and I believed until now because I realized all my life was and is just suffering, and God was nowhere in my life. I just feel so sad and betrayed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n![img](ofu8sng4urk51 \" \nCovid Depression by Jan Kudlacek\")",

When walking through my city's centre, i walked past a stall selling hamburgers. A guy who looked literally like a stereotypical doomer (beanie and jacket) has stopped me while walking. He asked me if i am clearing my mind walking around here. I am fairly introverted so at first i felt very nervous but i said yes i am. He talked to me about how he got depression in his 20s and ruined his life with drugs. How his laziness and carelessness ruined him as a whole, and basically told me to not repeat his mistakes, to work on myself, not be lazy and not to expect anyone else to do something for me. He was very chill and friendly, and also criticized how people today are very self-centered. And surprisingly enough, he got out of his drug addiction and is attempting to return to a normal life today. Will never forget that and always think of it when i walk at night again.",

I'm going to go from easy listening to harder stuff, so be prepped to have your ears obliterated if you choose to listen to this whole list no matter whatchu listen to, I get bipolar as fuck with it.\n\nIGOR - Tyler, The Creator: Easy listening but lyrics that resonate with me on a spiritual level, especially after finding my ex in bed with another man this one was on repeat.\n\nWolf - Tyler, The Creator: An album that deals with newfound and lost love, hatred, homocide, and anger.\n\nOff Da Zoinkeys - JID: Get off those drugs yo, make sure your vision is clear!\n\nDAMN - Kenderick Lamar: Recommend Pride off of this album, its a very mellow song with empowering vocals.\n\nBlack - Pearl Jam: A good break up song, and a song I planned to die to multiple times before, luckily I havent hit that curve yet, but perhaps some day. Ten as a whole is a great album for drive, but Black will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nThe Wall - Pink Floyd: Story of innocence lost, love gained and lost, and coming to terms with your own beasts and conquering them regardless of trauma or baggage.\n\nBlack Hole Sun - Soundgarden: A song that brings back the reminiscence of youth and innocence lost and forgotten\n\nPlanet Caravan - Pantera: Mellow drones and calm vocals, explaining the exestintiality and futility of our existence from an outside perspective.\n\nDeathconciousness - Have a Nice Life: Depressing and melodic, their songs switch from apathetic melody to aggressive drive.\n\nLife Is Killing Me - Type O Negative: Anesthesia and I Don't Wanna Be Me are two great songs off this album, I recommend their whole discography, but their songs have been some of the few to help me from in mental isolation.\n\nAround The Fur - Deftones: This album, for me, has been one of the few things to make me feel anything but apathy, it's ups and downs remind me of my own emotional highs and lows, as well as a very strong \"I'm about to break\" feeling all around.\n\nBurzum - Filosofem: This album, right here, brings me into nature and is a good night walk album if you dare to feel Varg's harsh vocals and distorted riffs.\n\nGrief - Germ: Black metal album that has a very sporadic feel and style to it, from aggresive French screams to Pink Floyd level reminiscence, the whole thing feels like a cry for help.\n\nPulver - Lifelover: One of the OG DSBM bands, the songs are agony inducing but also strong with instrumentals.\n\nRemember friends, our thoughts are our observations, not our reality.

I skimmed the stickied manifesto and thought the last part about creating an identity in the face of sociatel absurdity through expression was interesting, but looking at the posts and discussion I'm not really seeing it. In fact I see a depressive circle jerk that capitulates to the unyielding optimism that is so decryed.

I skimmed the stickied manifesto and thought the last part about creating an identity in the face of sociatel absurdity through expression was interesting, but looking at the posts and discussion I'm not really seeing it. In fact I see a depressive circle jerk that capitulates to the unyielding optimism that is so decryed.

Every institution and system of belief is just either corrupted or in decay. I mean, I have always had this feeling, but I always believed we could fight and work hard to destroy it and build something else in its stead. I had hope the pandemic would serve as the cleansing fire that would allow for something better to rise from the ashes. Instead it seems like those forces of decay and corruption are winning more than usual. I want to be a teacher and getting my MA in education (BA in History) but every person I talk to in the field talk about how bad it is and also the current discussions about CRT and attacks on teachers have me feeling like the profession isn't meant for me. \n\nI don't want to come off as an incel or one of those whiny guys on the internet but my love life is non-existent either.

   "body": "  \n\nWeek ago cousin was visiting my city and wanted to go to cinema with me. I was kinda excited since I didn’t go to cinema in years, literally it might be 10 years since last time I went.\n\nWe get there, get some popcorn and coke, lights turn off, movie starts and….

I moved back and realized nothing got better. I let her mess me up by not even being there for me. I just rot... I've been rotting for the last 5 months. Shit job. I never get any REM sleep. 2 to 3 hours of sleep each day. I see the sunrise before I sleep. My best friends pulled me aside and said that they don't see a soul in my eyes. The light in my eyes are gone. Dead. I dont feel anything anymore. I mimic the emotions of other people I see to get by. From 3 am to 6 am I'm just walking around in the nearby park with music blasting in my ears. I lost track of time. I dont even know what day it is. It's like im just a shell of someone years ago still existing. Not alive but also not dead. I had depression since I was 11. I managed. But now? There's a hole in my chest that can't be filled no matter the attempts. \n\nI'm finally done. I tired of it all. But it's no use. I can't find any solace.  No rest. I find only the lack of something.

I get high to deal with the pain but all it does is make shit worse cuz im in my head thinking about every fucked up thing in my life and within myself and I try to quit but I cant.

All the other times im just in my head tweakin tf out but I can't stop. Took a break for a year and now im back on it smh and been on it for damn near everyday of the quarantine just watching depressing shit and listening to dark music.

   "title": "How not to live your life (Extreme Mode)",
   "body": "Hey\n\nMy situation is so stupid and fucked up that maybe it will make some of you feel better. \n\nI'm French. 32. 33 in five days actually, but who cares ? I don't even want to celebrate it. \n\nSo. Back to 18. Got my high school diploma without having worked a single day in my scholarity, decent notes, insufferable wanker. Alt-right to say the least, cosplay as skinhead but not a street guy, crazy but decent middle class family. Cocky as fuck but deep down fearful, cold temperament, not very good for violence but at this age I'm so stupid I see myself as an alpha male, without providing any work to become one, 'cause good genetics and big dick (but too soft&nevrotic and also too much shameful secret submission fantasies to make good use of it)\n\nGo to college. Law faculty, not a good idea (should have done History but too disgusted by leftists at this time). I drop it pretty quick, I'm like \"oh whatever, Dad pays for it, let's have a sabbatic year and get serious next september\". Well freedom felt so good, but very poor life choices. Meet a girl during this 1st year. First girlfriend, first sexual relations. Stay 6 months with her, act like a complete prick, lose her, the next 4 months we still communicate online and we see each other sometime, but it's not serious, she plays with me, see another dude, and finally got a new boyfriend, I suffer a lot but I delete messenger and phone number, and try to get better.\n\nBut guess what, I don't. Still pretty obsessed by her. Start drinking too much, and alcohol makes me fucking mean, idiotic, hysterical, pathetic. But it numbs the pain and I didn't take that much drugs at this time. My few good friends start to get tired of me. \n\nWhat do I do the next 2 years ? Well, I suscribe to first year of Law faculty again, so THREE USELESS FUCKING YEARS pretending that I go to college and my grades are fine, but the truth is: I spend almost all my time on my computer, especially a twisted political forum where I forget my misery with other members, very funny content but very toxic amount of time spent on. \n\nSo I lie to my parents. I also lie to my friends, making up friends, parties, one night stands... actually I lie a lot, to everyone: pathological liar. Did it since high school because very empty, boring life, and too shallow to understand or change it. So, after 3 years of drinking cheap beers fucking alone on the internets, what happens ? Go back to parents house, that's right. Oh, and they moved to a small town, farewell big city pleasures. \n\nWhat do I do with my fucking life now ? Well, I'm an alpha male right ? So let's go the fucking army ! I'll do 5 years. Then I'll leave bulked gup, good sun tan, sure of myself. Yeah. Unfortunately my optics were also fucked up: SEVERE myopia, no-go for infantry, so I get the lazer surgery. But the good military doctors don't like the method employed (LASIK instead of older PKR), so still no regiments want me. \n\nAnd this is where it gets astronomically despiteful: people (online, or friends) start making fun of me because time passes and I'm still not incorporated. They think it's about my physical condition (sports) so I get angry. And one day, drunk, I tell them \"it's good I'm gonna get recruted soon\" and pff, here's another lie very difficult to preserve: actually it will be the last, and the deadliest. So fucking dumb, did the same thing with driving licence years back, because \"fake it until you make it\" yeah but the thing is, I didn't make it. \n\n(I precise: I'm perfectly aware I deserve my lose, my suffering... most doomers seems to be genuine good people, better than me anyway, so remember even if you're in pain, even if you think your life sucks, being a decent human being, having a good karma, is a PRECIOUS thing... very fucking precious, I assure you. Guilt is what kills me most, and innocence is what I miss the most, but hey, I was already a sociopathic little shit when I was kid)\n\nSo I start to get away from my friends (I think they didn't mind for I was becoming a giant asshole), pretending I'm in the army. Why do such a retarded thing ? Because at that time I'm thinking \"Nevermind, fuck the regular, I'll go to French Foreign Legion, then my lie will be buried deep in the ground\". \n\nYep. I go, but haha humor of the gods is something, I can't join because I take a pill, hiatal hernia, acidity: you can't join if you take medicine. So I get surgery for this too (for free this time, thanks to French healthcare). \n\nBut years have passed. Before this surgery, at 25 years old, I have an outstanding experience with LSD: Life transforms from monochrome to full colors. As I said I was kinda sociopathic: no empathy, no connection to others, no sensuality, no subtility, no esthetic nor emotional intelligence. All intellect, left cerebral hemispher. But this little blotter has woke up the right one... and Life changes, at last. \n\nI feel fucking ashamed for my lies, my perversion, my toxicity... all the people I've hurt with my words or my behavior. Above all I think about my ex (my only girlfriend, still at this day), I'm like \"it's so fucking unfair, if only this thing happened to me before we met... things would have been very different, I would have treated her way better\". Not \"fascist\" anymore btw, acid burned that shit. Try to stay human, ponderate.\n\nI cut all ties with the friends I had, because too fucking ashamed of myself. I slowly quit lying to others, but keep lying to myself. I start smoking cannabis, an unhealthy amount of cannabis... (sometimes 10g of good hashish smoked within a week, fucking insane, I must have smoked 2kg over 6 years...) \n\nI didn't smoke it very often when teenager, but I'm starting to fucking love it. Best part of my life: music. I discovered my type of music the same night I had my spiritual awakening. It's ambient, downtempo. Psychedelic music. Like Shpongle, Carbon Based Lifeforms, Koan, Kaya Project... I like to think that my musical tastes are very much and by far the best part of my personality.\n\nI spend whole days listening to music while smoking... It really cured me from within at the beginning, but then I'm starting to fall into drugs: waaaay too much LSD (couldn't even say how much time I did it, and I got to 900ug), ketamine, MDMA, heroin and other opiates, cocaine/crack not so much but sometimes... good thing is: I drink less, sometimes I didn't drink at all, because alcohol seems very boring to me compared to other substances. \n\nI don't work often. Sometimes 2 weeks, sometimes 3 months... (longest work experience: 9 months, lazy as fuck, and I regret it today). Drugs are killing me but they make me feel so good, so special, that I don't want to acknowledge it. Still depressive as fuck, make new friends (all drug users) but it's not like my youth friends, so I got bitter. \n\nMore and more suicidal thoughts. I don't do shit because I'm thinking \"I'm gone soon anyway\". Think I'll go to a better place. Lol. Nope, it doesn't work that way but let's keep going: so I'm spending all my work money (or more than often, welfare checks) on the Deep Web. Quality of products is insane, I order EVERY month. Especially LSD/Keta/Cannabis. I fucking destroy my already fragile mental health: psychotic delirium (pseudo-hallucinations, you \"hear\" voices in your head, not in your hears, it's almost always people talking shit about me). I don't get better at all: I'm more and more lunatic and ridicule, but I don't see it because perpetually stoned. \n\nI got weaker, and I was not very strong at the beginning... (\\~80kgs when coming back to my parents, 60 this year, managed to get back at 75kg since summer). I only see junkies, dealers, marginals, alcoholics, and I'm not happy with them. Sometimes violence, but fuck I'm not fearful anymore but I also don't have muscles anymore: logically, I got my ass kicked. And we all know it's so good for morals. \n\nTry to come back to my youth friends via Facebook, because it seems the right thing to do at this time (\\~28yo), we speak, I see one of them... but the link is broken. Too much lies, too much years have passed. I'll never see them again. Delete my FB. Very fucking sad but don't show it, I assume I deserved it. I still miss them so much at this day. \n\nDepression continues, but I'm starting to withdraw from drugs... very slowly, will take years. And what happens in 2020 ? My fucking ex sends me an email. I sent her some years back, but she never replied.  I would have never expected this... I REALLY saw it as miracle. She was with a guy for 6 years, house with pool, good life, but she wants to leave it. Seduce her with my words: not difficult, she wanted a romance more than anything. \n\n(NB: the last mail I sent her before she went back to me was \"please don't do anything stupid, be strong\" because I felt on acid that she was suicidal, and I was right, it is what makes her want to talk to me again... Telepathy, coincidence ? Who the fuck knows...)\n\nIt was during covid/quarantine. So we have this delightful few months of phone calls and textos... She's like me deep in spirituality/esoterism: astrology, tarot, spiritism, reiki... she wants to quit her stressful office job and become therapist. Well at first I'm afraid because I'm a TOTAL FUCKING LOSER (live with my parents, no driving licence, on bike, no viable friends, no activities, no ambition...) but I believe it, I think it must be destiny who reunites us after 10 freakin' years, it must be right ?! I'm so happy, I was right to still love her all these years ! It was not a oneitis, it's my soulmate, my only love in this life ! \n\nYeah well it will not surprise you, but things didn't happen as I planned. I was still smoking cannabis, and I was too involved in occult shit that was too abstract/irrational/socially awkward for her, I was still trying to find a religion at this moment (nowadays I couldn't give a fuck, actually bores me). \n\nSo I was too soft, AGAIN. In bed, in words, everything: I fucked up totally, AGAIN. Cannabis made me irrationnal and naive as hell. We're both unhappy. 10 months later, got dumped, and probably cucked the last 3 months. Didn't fulfill my promises: I was supposed to do sports (she didn't show it but she was not pleased to find me so skinny), I did not. Did not keep money. Did not stop drinking or doing drugs. Only effort was to keep 9 months a job I fucking hated. \n\nI treated the miracle like shit, but it was not a miracle... it was an error, she fell in love with the texts and the phone calls, but was disappointed IRL. Who wouldn't ? Total fucking loser. \n\nLose my shit at the breakup, because she doesn't have the decency of doing it orally but with an hypocritical text. Insult her like I've never insulted anybody. Deeply regret it after. I'll never see her again, but it's probably for the best: I was shitty but she's a cold, calculating person. \n\nTFW when waiting 10 years for a 10 months relationship who was EXCRUCIATELY frustrating, for both of us. No eternal love, no soul bond, nothing. Back to the void. \n\nAlmost 2 fucking years to get over it (yeah, I'm very stupid, emotionaly, very fragile...) \n\nOnly girl in my life as I said, a (very) few one night stands excepted. Good thing is: I was soooo fucking angry at myself I'm fucking done with sub/femboy fantasies, I stopped dreaming of a maternal/domme gf who simply doesn't exist: men must be men because women are women, I don't know if it sucks but it's life. Period. \n\nI noticed that the best way to become sexually dominant is to be successful in violence. You smash a mofo's mouth, you feel great, you're sure of you around girls. Sex and violence are totally interconnected. Just do it to an asshole who's looking for trouble: it's almost pedagogic for him. \n\nPlus the guy in Fight Club may have fucked up ideas on how we should live, but he's definitively right for one thing: best way to learn about yourself is to fight someone. That and company of a girl, is what   makes you grow in life. It's natural, animal, primordial functions: everything proceeds from sex and violence. \n\nAnd here I am now. Still living with my mother. My father died at the beginning of this year, his spirit must be even more disappointed of me that when he was alive. Sometimes I think I accelerated his demise, his sickness, his death. I hated him. Now I see he was a angry/troubled but good person at heart, and I regret my coldness and my ingratitude towards him. He saw me decaying at my floor for 10 years. My mother doesn't seem to care, I guess having a presence suits her. My sisters, hey, I think they pretend to like me out of kindness, but who loves a fucking neet/junky ? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying a NEET or an addict doesn't deserve love, it's just that... it's more complicated to love them. I've dwellt among drug addicts and alcoholics for years, can't say I loved a lot of them (but then again, I'm a sociopathic little shit who discovered empathy at 25 with acid)\n\nNo money. No career. No fucking car to transport my stuff to a small apartment anyway. Trapped in a 15k population boring town deep in Western France (could be worse though, there's countries where I would have starved long time ago, French people often forget their luck, but what can we say, it can be a depressing place even with material comfort). \n\nNo friends. No love. But I don't care anymore, that's why makes me a Doomer now: I accept my loss, I don't want a girlfriend anymore, my life is too shitty for that. We'll see in a few years if still alive. Don't care about friends, I ordered a PS5 and I have a streaming subscription. \n\nSomehow vanquished the suicidal thoughts: they were at their max this year, tried 2 times to hang myself in the woods, painless method but too afraid to do it, I believe that suicide doesn't solve your problems at all, you're just trapped in the dark, in suffering, and you can't do shit about it anymore, better to wait the end, and I know it's very easy to say... but psychedelics/NDE don't lie. Pain makes you closer to God. The more you endure here, the more your afterlife will be pleasant, not to mention if you kill yourself your next life will look awfully resemblant of the previous, except it will be shittier.\n\nI've let go of happiness: I don't seek it anymore. I don't believe in it no more. I don't care. Life seems absurd, but hey, modern technology can make it very pleasant, even if not fulfilling -we all have a mission here, a formula, but we must find what it is... it's not easy for everyone. \n\nStill have my auditive hallucinations, tried psychiatry for two weeks this year, but hated it: false feeling of security, infantilization, and meds suck, I prefer to suffer than to be chemically numbed.\n\nRarely smoke cannabis, so when I do it's awesome (one time per month, just 2/3g). Trying to quit alcohol forever, because you shouldn't drunk when depressed (even if yeah, you feel better at first, but it never lasts, right..?) Ketamine, cocaine, heroin... no more. Fucksake I even tried crystal meth one time. Will still do LSD and DMT, because hey, it makes a better person. \n\nI just need to save some money, enough to rent a small apartment in a decent city. To pass the driving licence when far from this shithole (not even good enough for nightwalking), with new accointances and a long-term job. It's not that difficult, so I really hope 2022 was the last stage of my dive, the bottom. So I can go up. Even if don't make it to the surface, to see the light again would be nice. \n\nGood luck to everyone. May you see magic in Life, 'cause everything is magic, but it's so easy to forget it. There's a quote I like: \"Work is love made visible\". I should have worked. It's not too late, even if the burden seems heavy, even if possibilities are now reducted. But as long as you're breathing... don't give up. Life does have its surprises. 30's is still a young age. \n\nTL;DR: could have been a decent fellow, had amazing friends, nice girl, could have done interesting studies: ruined everything by being a lying intoxicated annoying piece of shit.",

So let's go the fucking army ! I'll do 5 years. Then I'll leave bulked gup, good sun tan, sure of myself. Yeah. Unfortunately my optics were also fucked up: SEVERE myopia, no-go for infantry, so I get the lazer surgery. But the good military doctors don't like the method employed  LASIK instead of older PKR , so still no regiments want me. \n\nAnd this is where it gets astronomically despiteful: people  online, or friends  start making fun of me because time passes and I'm still not incorporated. They think it's about my physical condition  sports  so I get angry. And one day, drunk, I tell them \"it's good I'm gonna get recruted soon\" and pff, here's another lie very difficult to preserve: actually it will be the last, and the deadliest. So fucking dumb, did the same thing with driving licence years back, because \"fake it until you make it\" yeah but the thing is, I didn't make it. \n\n I precise: I'm perfectly aware I deserve my lose, my suffering... most doomers seems to be genuine good people, better than me anyway, so remember even if you're in pain, even if you think your life sucks, being a decent human being, having a good karma, is a PRECIOUS thing... very fucking precious, I assure you. Guilt is what kills me most, and innocence is what I miss the most, but hey, I was already a sociopathic little shit when I was kid \n\nSo I start to get away from my friends  I think they didn't mind for I was becoming a giant asshole , pretending I'm in the army. Why do such a retarded thing ? Because at that time I'm thinking \"Nevermind, fuck the regular, I'll go to French Foreign Legion, then my lie will be buried deep in the ground\". \n\nYep. I go, but haha humor of the gods is something, I can't join because I take a pill, hiatal hernia, acidity: you can't join if you take medicine. So I get surgery for this too  for free this time, thanks to French healthcare . \n\nBut years have passed. Before this surgery, at 25 years old, I have an outstanding experience with LSD: Life transforms from monochrome to full colors. As I said I was kinda sociopathic: no empathy, no connection to others, no sensuality, no subtility, no esthetic nor emotional intelligence. All intellect, left cerebral hemispher. But this little blotter has woke up the right one... and Life changes, at last. \n\nI feel fucking ashamed for my lies, my perversion, my toxicity... all the people I've hurt with my words or my behavior. Above all I think about my ex  my only girlfriend, still at this day , I'm like \"it's so fucking unfair, if only this thing happened to me before we met... things would have been very different, I would have treated her way better\". Not \"fascist\" anymore btw, acid burned that shit. Try to stay human, ponderate.\n\nI cut all ties with the friends I had, because too fucking ashamed of myself. I slowly quit lying to others, but keep lying to myself. I start smoking cannabis, an unhealthy amount of cannabis...  sometimes 10g of good hashish smoked within a week, fucking insane, I must have smoked 2kg over 6 years...  \n\nI didn't smoke it very often when teenager, but I'm starting to fucking love it. Best part of my life: music. I discovered my type of music the same night I had my spiritual awakening. It's ambient, downtempo. Psychedelic music. Like Shpongle, Carbon Based Lifeforms, Koan, Kaya Project... I like to think that my musical tastes are very much and by far the best part of my personality.\n\nI spend whole days listening to music while smoking... It really cured me from within at the beginning, but then I'm starting to fall into drugs: waaaay too much LSD  couldn't even say how much time I did it, and I got to 900ug , ketamine, MDMA, heroin and other opiates, cocaine/crack not so much but sometimes... good thing is: I drink less, sometimes I didn't drink at all, because alcohol seems very boring to me compared to other substances. \n\nI don't work often. Sometimes 2 weeks, sometimes 3 months...  longest work experience: 9 months, lazy as fuck, and I regret it today . Drugs are killing me but they make me feel so good, so special, that I don't want to acknowledge it. Still depressive as fuck, make new friends  all drug users  but it's not like my youth friends, so I got bitter. \n\nMore and more suicidal thoughts. I don't do shit because I'm thinking \"I'm gone soon anyway\". Think I'll go to a better place. Lol. Nope, it doesn't work that way but let's keep going: so I'm spending all my work money  or more than often, welfare checks  on the Deep Web. Quality of products is insane, I order EVERY month. Especially LSD/Keta/Cannabis. I fucking destroy my already fragile mental health: psychotic delirium  pseudo-hallucinations, you \"hear\" voices in your head, not in your hears, it's almost always people talking shit about me . I don't get better at all: I'm more and more lunatic and ridicule, but I don't see it because perpetually stoned. \n\nI got weaker, and I was not very strong at the beginning...  \\~80kgs when coming back to my parents, 60 this year, managed to get back at 75kg since summer . I only see junkies, dealers, marginals, alcoholics, and I'm not happy with them. Sometimes violence, but fuck I'm not fearful anymore but I also don't have muscles anymore: logically, I got my ass kicked. And we all know it's so good for morals. \n\nTry to come back to my youth friends via Facebook, because it seems the right thing to do at this time  \\~28yo , we speak, I see one of them... but the link is broken. Too much lies, too much years have passed. I'll never see them again. Delete my FB. Very fucking sad but don't show it, I assume I deserved it. I still miss them so much at this day. \n\nDepression continues, but I'm starting to withdraw from drugs... very slowly, will take years. And what happens in 2020 ? My fucking ex sends me an email. I sent her some years back, but she never replied.  I would have never expected this... I REALLY saw it as miracle. She was with a guy for 6 years, house with pool, good life, but she wants to leave it. Seduce her with my words: not difficult, she wanted a romance more than anything. \n\n NB: the last mail I sent her before she went back to me was \"please don't do anything stupid, be strong\" because I felt on acid that she was suicidal, and I was right, it is what makes her want to talk to me again... Telepathy, coincidence ? Who the fuck knows... \n\nIt was during covid/quarantine. So we have this delightful few months of phone calls and textos... She's like me deep in spirituality/esoterism: astrology, tarot, spiritism, reiki... she wants to quit her stressful office job and become therapist. Well at first I'm afraid because I'm a TOTAL FUCKING LOSER  live with my parents, no driving licence, on bike, no viable friends, no activities, no ambition...  but I believe it, I think it must be destiny who reunites us after 10 freakin' years, it must be right ?! I'm so happy, I was right to still love her all these years ! It was not a oneitis, it's my soulmate, my only love in this life ! \n\nYeah well it will not surprise you, but things didn't happen as I planned. I was still smoking cannabis, and I was too involved in occult shit that was too abstract/irrational/socially awkward for her, I was still trying to find a religion at this moment  nowadays I couldn't give a fuck, actually bores me . \n\nSo I was too soft, AGAIN. In bed, in words, everything: I fucked up totally, AGAIN. Cannabis made me irrationnal and naive as hell. We're both unhappy. 10 months later, got dumped, and probably cucked the last 3 months. Didn't fulfill my promises: I was supposed to do sports  she didn't show it but she was not pleased to find me so skinny , I did not. Did not keep money. Did not stop drinking or doing drugs. Only effort was to keep 9 months a job I fucking hated. \n\nI treated the miracle like shit, but it was not a miracle... it was an error, she fell in love with the texts and the phone calls, but was disappointed IRL. Who wouldn't ? Total fucking loser. \n\nLose my shit at the breakup, because she doesn't have the decency of doing it orally but with an hypocritical text. Insult her like I've never insulted anybody. Deeply regret it after. I'll never see her again, but it's probably for the best: I was shitty but she's a cold, calculating person. \n\nTFW when waiting 10 years for a 10 months relationship who was EXCRUCIATELY frustrating, for both of us. No eternal love, no soul bond, nothing. Back to the void. \n\nAlmost 2 fucking years to get over it  yeah, I'm very stupid, emotionaly, very fragile...  \n\nOnly girl in my life as I said, a  very  few one night stands excepted. Good thing is: I was soooo fucking angry at myself I'm fucking done with sub/femboy fantasies, I stopped dreaming of a maternal/domme gf who simply doesn't exist: men must be men because women are women, I don't know if it sucks but it's life. Period. \n\nI noticed that the best way to become sexually dominant is to be successful in violence. You smash a mofo's mouth, you feel great, you're sure of you around girls. Sex and violence are totally interconnected. Just do it to an asshole who's looking for trouble: it's almost pedagogic for him. \n\nPlus the guy in Fight Club may have fucked up ideas on how we should live, but he's definitively right for one thing: best way to learn about yourself is to fight someone. That and company of a girl, is what   makes you grow in life. It's natural, animal, primordial functions: everything proceeds from sex and violence. \n\nAnd here I am now. Still living with my mother. My father died at the beginning of this year, his spirit must be even more disappointed of me that when he was alive. Sometimes I think I accelerated his demise, his sickness, his death. I hated him. Now I see he was a angry/troubled but good person at heart, and I regret my coldness and my ingratitude towards him. He saw me decaying at my floor for 10 years. My mother doesn't seem to care, I guess having a presence suits her. My sisters, hey, I think they pretend to like me out of kindness, but who loves a fucking neet/junky ? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying a NEET or an addict doesn't deserve love, it's just that... it's more complicated to love them. I've dwellt among drug addicts and alcoholics for years, can't say I loved a lot of them  but then again, I'm a sociopathic little shit who discovered empathy at 25 with acid \n\nNo money. No career. No fucking car to transport my stuff to a small apartment anyway. Trapped in a 15k population boring town deep in Western France  could be worse though, there's countries where I would have starved long time ago, French people often forget their luck, but what can we say, it can be a depressing place even with material comfort . \n\nNo friends. No love. But I don't care anymore, that's why makes me a Doomer now: I accept my loss, I don't want a girlfriend anymore, my life is too shitty for that. We'll see in a few years if still alive. Don't care about friends, I ordered a PS5 and I have a streaming subscription. \n\nSomehow vanquished the suicidal thoughts: they were at their max this year, tried 2 times to hang myself in the woods, painless method but too afraid to do it, I believe that suicide doesn't solve your problems at all, you're just trapped in the dark, in suffering, and you can't do shit about it anymore, better to wait the end, and I know it's very easy to say... but psychedelics/NDE don't lie. Pain makes you closer to God. The more you endure here, the more your afterlife will be pleasant, not to mention if you kill yourself your next life will look awfully resemblant of the previous, except it will be shittier.\n\nI've let go of happiness: I don't seek it anymore. I don't believe in it no more. I don't care. Life seems absurd, but hey, modern technology can make it very pleasant, even if not fulfilling -we all have a mission here, a formula, but we must find what it is... it's not easy for everyone. \n\nStill have my auditive hallucinations, tried psychiatry for two weeks this year, but hated it: false feeling of security, infantilization, and meds suck, I prefer to suffer than to be chemically numbed.\n\nRarely smoke cannabis, so when I do it's awesome  one time per month, just 2/3g . Trying to quit alcohol forever, because you shouldn't drunk when depressed  even if yeah, you feel better at first, but it never lasts, right..?  Ketamine, cocaine, heroin... no more. Fucksake I even tried crystal meth one time. Will still do LSD and DMT, because hey, it makes a better person. \n\nI just need to save some money, enough to rent a small apartment in a decent city. To pass the driving licence when far from this shithole  not even good enough for nightwalking , with new accointances and a long-term job. It's not that difficult, so I really hope 2022 was the last stage of my dive, the bottom. So I can go up. Even if don't make it to the surface, to see the light again would be nice. \n\nGood luck to everyone. May you see magic in Life, 'cause everything is magic, but it's so easy to forget it. There's a quote I like: \"Work is love made visible\". I should have worked. It's not too late, even if the burden seems heavy, even if possibilities are now reducted. But as long as you're breathing... don't give up. Life does have its surprises. 30's is still a young age. \n\nTL;DR: could have been a decent fellow, had amazing friends, nice girl, could have done interesting studies: ruined everything by being a lying intoxicated annoying piece of shit. https://www.reddit.com/r/doomer/comments/yvjspl/how_not_to_live_your_life_extreme_mode/",

   "body": "saw a post here about the reasons we become doomers, which got me thinking.\nIt’s cause I think too much, especially about the past and perceived “mistakes” and “missed opportunities,” even though it’s impossible for me to know how things would’ve turned out. Outwardly, my life doesn’t appear bad at all: good grades, good parents, good home (relatively). I don’t have any disabilities or disorders, I don’t do drugs. But I don’t value these things, I just get so caught up on these notions of what’s good or what’s right.\n\nI’m not like others, I don’t have friends really, don’t see any value in social interactions. I think all the little things we’re expected to do (small talk, things like that) are just bullshit. Mostly just keep to myself and stick to my routines. Do schoolwork, keep clean, browse the internet, watch videos/movies, listen to music, play games, workout, space out and just think and imagine. Have a lot of interests but not many hobbies, I can just stay in my room and do “nothing” all day. I prefer to be alone. And the thing is, there’s nothing wrong with that. But because of all the thinking, I keep telling myself there is.\n\nI’ve been too exposed to other people seemingly enjoying life more than me. It makes me think there’s something wrong with what I’m doing, like I’m a loser. Couple that with a lack of outlets and natural, acute perceptiveness and I’ve got no way to escape myself. If I could just be satisfied with myself, my life would likely be easier. I’m too aware of it all, my feelings included. I don’t show much emotion, yet I feel very deeply. And when the thoughts get filtered through the emotional layer, the dark washes over me like a wave, too strong to resist. To be in control is something I value perhaps more than anything, and overthinking makes me lose it. \n\nThe thinking helps me manage complexity well and keeps my mind sharp and organized, and when it is paired with my feeling I appreciate things truly meaningfully, forming strong emotional connections with the things that reach me. But it also makes it so difficult to just let go, even of the smallest things like how a chair is placed. It feeds the depression, anxiety, makes it hard to feel satisfied and makes the daily routines of life draining and monotonous. Two sides to the same coin.\n\nSociety hasn’t particularly chewed me up yet, save for the school system which I only blame in part for the way I am. Girl didn’t do it either, never had a girlfriend, never really been close. Feel pangs of loneliness and longing, but mostly devoid of it all. Empty. It’s just me. I’m the one responsible, which in some ways is worse than the other culprits; I can control it, but I fail to do so. \n\nI do not know why I write this post, knowing very well that it may not reach many people, and that I usually keep my writing to myself. Hell, this whole long-ass post itself is a product of overthinking, this particular paragraph especially. Guess I feel the need to explain myself at some level, and preserve my ideas so I don’t forget them. For what it’s worth, I have felt more connected to you lot than most others. One thing I wish I had at times was a fellow doomer to just hang around, in a relationship where both of us could truly be who we are without being looked down upon by the public, together in our sorrows.

   "body": "i've been looking at this subbreddit for awhile, but decided not to post untill now because I felt like my story/opinion wasn't needed. The point of this was just to try and vent a little, because my school therapist stopped reaching out to me for some reason (who i'd only been with for 1 session) idk if i did something wrong but thats besides the point.\n\nLife like, sucks.\n\nThere isn't much of a point to it, and all of the joys of life last so little time. Yet things like anxiety, depression, intense feelings of emptiness and dread just last so long. It feels like a bad deal, like whatever the fuck made us if anything even did in the first place dealt us a dirty hand. \n\nI have an ok relationship with my friends, but the thing is that im white, which they have a huge problem with. I personally believe that you can't actually be racist to white people but I dont think that warrants you to treat me like a piece of shit all the time because im white, I used to be more vocal about things like that but all it did was get me outcasted so I just play along with it and it leaves me better off. I have to go to school with my ex boyfriend aswell, which is only a danger to me & him.\n\nGoing to school with my ex hurts.\n\nWe met in 2019 late september and got together in may 2020. He always treated me like shit throughout our relationship, he made fun of my alcoholic mother and abusive dad +my overall dysfunctional family. He made it seem like I couldn't leave him without being a bad person when I knew he was just desperate for any kind of love, ontop of all that he also sexually harassed and eventually sexually assaulted me. I don't know how I feel about it, most of the time I feel nothing at all about anything, but seeing his face sometimes makes me want to crack his head over a table.\n\nBeing Bisexual doesn't help.\n\nMy friends from the state I used to live in don't talk to me very much, mainly because I came out as bisexual and they just shamed me for even daring to like boys. My mom isn't very fond of it either, and if my dad ever found out i'd be dead. My father would disown me if he knew I was bi, which really scares me.\n\nMy father.\n\nis an absolute cunt. I once considered throwing my life away to torture him for hours in my basement then kill myself to keep from going to jail, although its either I value my life more than I used to (I doubt it) or im too much of a puss boy to do it. He physically abused us atleast once a month when we lived with him and verbally abused us every day, I left when I was 9 and have only heard from him on the phone since. Its court order that he gets to talk to us, so speaking fake to him on the phone and him pretending he did nothing wrong makes my blood boil. I can't say anything about it though, or my mom will spiral into depression.\n\nMy mother.\n\nI dont know how I feel about my mother, I love her, yet shes an ignorant asshole. She plays victim in every situation she possibly can and never recognizes her faults. The worst thing that happened was I was casually watching a show with my siblings November 2020, and my mom walks in my room drunk out of her mind and slaps me purely because she was pissed about something. After hitting back out of suprise and running away to keep the fight from happening, she tackled me and scratched at my face and punched, trying to pin me. She proceeded to call me weak for being able to pin me so easy while she ripped my hair out, even though I was trying not to hurt her. I turned her over and punched her in a flurry of anger and immediately stopped midway through and ran down the street. I ended up giving her a black eye and she guilt tripped me for the next few days or so, and she walked into my room around 2 days later and demanded an apology from me. I never got my apology, nor have I for the countless other times this has happened. She verbally and sometimes physically absues my siblings, who I have partially taken role as father for. She tells me all the time that im gonna end up like my father and get charged for domestic violence of physical abuse... but im trying my best not to be like him.\n\nI almost offed myself a few times,\n\n3 to be exact. I wanted to do it by overdose, slitting my wrists, then just jumping in traffic. I don't know why I wanted to, but to be honest I also dont know why not. I still dont know if I should or not. But to be fair it doesn't make a difference.\n\nIm only roughly summarizing the shit that happened to me, but I don't think I need to elaborate every bad thing thats ever happened to me. Cigarettes kinda help, like rolled with paper and filled with tea. My mom caught me smoking at one point, aswell as drinking. She kinda just brushed it off, like expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't feel like im gonna head anywhere in life, maybe stuck at some dead end job at some kinda music studio at best. But who knows, maybe my life will be some crazy shit like whatever kinda anime or show I watch and i'll become special all of the sudden.\n\nAtleast thats what I tell myself.\n\nI've only got one feelable emotion left, and thats love.\n\nThere is a guy I have a crush on in my class, but he thinks im too white for him to date anyway, i guess thats fair. He's gay, but I don't even think hes interested in me. I don't even care anymore, I think I really love him. I don't care how he treats me for being white I just want to be loved by him, loved by anyone beside my family who im not even sure loves me anymore. \n\nI think this is where im supposed to cry while writing this, but I feel too empty to actually cry. I haven't cried in so long, I haven't expressed genuine emotion in so long.\n\nI dunno what im gonna do.",

I ended up giving her a black eye and she guilt tripped me for the next few days or so, and she walked into my room around 2 days later and demanded an apology from me. I never got my apology, nor have I for the countless other times this has happened. She verbally and sometimes physically absues my siblings, who I have partially taken role as father for. She tells me all the time that im gonna end up like my father and get charged for domestic violence of physical abuse... but im trying my best not to be like him.\n\nI almost offed myself a few times,\n\n3 to be exact. I wanted to do it by overdose, slitting my wrists, then just jumping in traffic. I don't know why I wanted to, but to be honest I also dont know why not. I still dont know if I should or not. But to be fair it doesn't make a difference.\n\nIm only roughly summarizing the shit that happened to me, but I don't think I need to elaborate every bad thing thats ever happened to me. Cigarettes kinda help, like rolled with paper and filled with tea. My mom caught me smoking at one point, aswell as drinking. She kinda just brushed it off, like expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't feel like im gonna head anywhere in life, maybe stuck at some dead end job at some kinda music studio at best. But who knows, maybe my life will be some crazy shit like whatever kinda anime or show I watch and i'll become special all of the sudden.\n\nAtleast thats what I tell myself.\n\nI've only got one feelable emotion left, and thats love.\n\nThere is a guy I have a crush on in my class, but he thinks im too white for him to date anyway, i guess thats fair. He's gay, but I don't even think hes interested in me. I don't even care anymore, I think I really love him. I don't care how he treats me for being white I just want to be loved by him, loved by anyone beside my family who im not even sure loves me anymore. \n\nI think this is where im supposed to cry while writing this, but I feel too empty to actually cry. I haven't cried in so long, I haven't expressed genuine emotion in so long.\n\nI dunno what im gonna do. https://www.reddit.com/r/doomer/comments/pz2sun/hello/",

They were also super stressed so I got to hear my drunk dad talking shit while my mom cried. While driving me to school he said multiple times that he wants to kill himself and during my 7th year of age it wasn't super pleasing to hear. My siblings were also not so warm to me (actually they were as repulsive as my parents), and in result I cried a lot as a child. Siblings also do not have good relations with my parents because of them constantly working. This picture lead me to believe money is the only thing worth in the world. Instead of being taught how to cope with my feelings, I was screamed at for crying so much. This resulted in me being enclosed only to myself and not revealing ANY feelings because I believe even now I get shit for talking about my feelings. No one ever cared about me, saw my endless crying and still didn't even do anything about it. Countless times I cried on my way to home from school because school was no different from home and I kept saying to myself that something is wrong with me and that I should get checked at therapist. Everyone was super cold to me. I was, and still am very different from people my age so during my school years I was constantly being picked on for everything about my appearance and behaviour. An older \"friend\" of mine said that my sister said that I am some kind of autist, of course, behind my back.\n\nMy strongest ability was my brain when I was a child. I constantly wanted to do jigsaw puzzles, I was interested in physics, universe and it's nature, geography, animals, mathematics and so on. My father tried to teach me chess at the age of 5 or 6. I loved it, but my father, being the only teacher, made it a horrible experience for me, because I didn't like the way he was teaching and told him about it. He didn't care because he thought it's the best way to teach someone something. Maybe he's right, but it's certainly not the best way to teach someone also LOVE the game. In fact I cried a lot during these sessions and he wouldn't switch teaching technique even after I told him i don't want him to behave like that, while crying my eyes out as a literal child, so I started to hate chess instead. And so during the whole elementary school, I was left with basically nothing. Repulsive family, hateful classmates, stressful environment, sad and lonely feelings, no interest in hobbies I used to love earlier and no interest in school and it's subjects.\n\nUp to now being a depressed, sad anti-social my whole life, comming to high school was no different from middle school. Now I think about past, that I had so much potential in my brain power (not bragging, just saying it was my strongest page), that I could've just studied the hardest throughout the entire high school (electrical engineering), maybe do some outside activity and I would've been okay by now. But I did literally nothing during high school. I had one of the worst grades from the entire class, nearly didn't pass a grade and just played video games, smoked weed, drank and jerked off. By now, I would've been ready to apply for university which I didn't go to, then apply for an electrician job with special title u must get outside of school, go working abroad for a guaranteed job that pays at least 40K/year (very different from my country's average salary of around 16K/year) and with head full of knowledge from school, drive to be better and potential in this sector, I would've had a nice future. Instead, I got nothing from 4 years and countless hours spent in school, no education, no ambitions, no money or social skills, since throughout the entire school life (13 years) I only had 7 girl classmates and almost no friendly male or female classmates. Now, I have literally nothing more than an average person my age. I have the mentioned average salary, no hobbies, no gf, no interest in anything, addictive personality, cold and often-arguing family, long lasting depression, no purpose in life and no drive to get better in life. If I just wasn't so blind and dumb, if I tried my hardest in school, wouldn't be disctracted by p\\*rn, video games and weed and just spent some extra years in university, I would've had maybe more opportunities to get a gf, more knowledge, title, more opportunities to land a good paying, quality job and opened doors outside this shithole country of an european union to more developed and better countries. I am stuck in life and don't see a way out of this monotone, boring and hopeless life of mine.\n\nI've tried many hobbies in all sorts directions, didn't take long for them to just stop being interesting anymore. I've tried playing piano, drums, chess, making music, coding, photoshop, lifting, learning languages, cooking, soccer, athletics and many more, yet nothing kept me interested in them for longer than few months. I didn't find a purpose in any of the tens of hobbies I tried, not in socializing (in this age lol), not in money (tried to make money, made some outside my salary and just didn't see a point in it). I maybe see the life I could've had as the better one that I have now and it's not good to view it like that, but what is for sure I am stuck in my hopeless life with average salary, average body, no gf, no family, no hobbies, no friends and no purpose. Basically just a touch starving, KHHV with nothing to achieve\n\nTL:DR Kids stay in school and study the hardest you can.

   "body": "2/18/2022\n\nI don’t think I’m happy. \n\nI mean I really don’t think I’m satisfied with the reality of the world we are forced to exist in. I mean we live in a world of student debts, police brutality, a pandemic that killed millions of people but was also a super weapon from China but also wasn’t real, but also wasn’t wasn’t because it is still happening but also isn’t because the government said its not to appease big corporation who will end up ruling us all anyways and heaven forbid that their precious assets are damaged physically. I end up thinking about these things a lot. Probably more than the average person but how would I know that. Death and eternity and the meaning of life and the other sorts of things that you end up thing about late at night in a hotel while listening to post rock instrumental trying not to give yourself a panic attack because you know you have to be up early to play a show but you cant stop thinking and so you sit there paralyzed by the infinity sitting on your chest hoping to not bother anyone else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n\nhave been at the forefront of my mind for as long as I can remember and I want something to change. \n\nUpon reading the surrealist manifesto by Andre Brenton I decided to try a new form of meditation. While meditation usually involves slowing down the mind and not thinking of anything, I’ve decided to try the exact opposite: ten minutes a day of concentrated imagination. Quite literally letting my mind go wild and seeing what the results of that are. In the surrealist manifesto its talked about how imagination tends to decline in people after a certain age, however as an artist I do not want that to happen to me. My proposition is that by training my own imagination I can remain more creative on a long scale. \n\nI had this idea while at work where I tend to go off on long research tangents in between projects. In my office space nothing really feels real.  I’m a jazz musician but I work at a church  my dad started doing office work. Due to unfortunate circumstances in my past I am not allowed to play with the church band, despite being a crucial part for years. This has created a strange mix of emotions every time I am on campus. There is the trauma of the circumstances combined with the frustration of not being able to play music and on top of it there is the longing for purpose, for my job to mean something. It is this strange mixture of feelings that can often leave my head in a very weird space. I often stumble about in a daze or even sit and stare at nothing and freak out because there is so much that I will never be able to understand and discover, or the opposite can happen and I become entranced in research about a topic that interests me frantically hoping to learn more but also knowing that I will neve be able to understand or even be exposed to a fraction of what is out there. This has often resulted in a sort of derealization where nothing in the office feels real. Now the building itself does not help with that either. In addition to the typical gray walls and bright LEDs watching over me there are some other factors that can really make the space feel weird. The most prime example of this is a particular set of doors. At the end of a long hallway there is a door on the left and a door on the right.  The door to the right leads to a storage space and the door on the left leads to another office. But the trippy part is that standing in the doorway and looking to the left you can see the doorway out of the next office directly in front of you. Then after that you can see the next doorway and this goes on for about five doors. It gives the feeling of looking at two mirrors reflecting off of one another and cascading into infinity. It is a trippy thing to see and always feels just out of place, like something in a dream. This reminded me of how in the manifesto it talks about how we give more credence to our waking hours because memory decides to cut out dreams and thus imaginations. It was in this weird state of mind that I formed my plan. \n\nYesterday I had both a success and a failure. The success came in an interesting place, contemporary jazz rehearsal of all places! This rehearsal is directly after my work and so I am already in a strange mindset, but that is beside the point. There was a repetitive exercise in time that we were doing. Essentially the rhythm section was playing a bassline, in this case it was Cornbread by Lee Morgan. It's a very simple and very repetitive bassline with a sort of minor pentatonic groovy feel to it and a large emphasis on the down beat. The instructor had us repeat this bassline while he would subdivide the measure into three beats or five beats or seven beats or some other sort of odd meter. The goal was to feel these polyrhythms while maintaining the integrity of the line. We did this for quite some time. I mean it was probably thirty or forty minutes of just playing that line and focusing on your own sense of time. It was very easy to get into ones own mind and so I did. I started thinking about where I would hear this music if it was a soundtrack and so I closed my eyes. What I saw shocked me.\n\nI was greeted with an apocalyptic late stage capitalism neo industrial cityscape. I mean the sky was a dark sickly green with huge clouds and a feverish yellow green luminescence. I couldn’t tell if it was day or night but there was rain coming down past the tall skyscrapers. Skyscrapers with green glass and grey ugly steel, sort of how New York lives in my mind when its stuck in a green lense cap. There was red too. A lot of red but I couldn't tell you where it came from. I was on the concrete and there was rain coming down. Puddles formed around me reflecting the green and red lights, but not in a holiday sort of way. More of a chemical factory level of a superhero game that you play on your DS while hoping that your parents stop fighting sort of way. But it was so vivid. I felt the music encapsulate all of that. Serious chills ran up and down my body, if sex was is an orgasm of the body this was an orgasm of the mind. I felt an emotion that I can’t describe. Wonder and confusion and horror and joy and deep depression all wrapped into one. And then it was gone. I was back in rehearsal. I was still playing the line, but everything seemed a little more real or a little less real. I don’t know, reality got a little blurry after that. \n\nI tried to imagine when I got home at around 10 but one thing led to another and it did not happen. I sat down on my bed and tried to get into the mindset but I couldn’t and soon after I got a phone call.  Perhaps my mind needs musical stimulation to start, but I don’t want to direct it or influence it in any way. I guess we’ll see where it goes. I’m going to try again tonight, or maybe I won’t, I never seem to follow through with even my own plans. Maybe I will become happy and healthy through this or maybe I’ll explore My mind a little too much and hate myself all the more because of it. I guess we’ll have to wait and see. \n\nI’ll soon forget about this project as I am apt to do, but I hope someday in the future after I die and my kids try to understand who I was, because I probably won’t be able to open up to them either, that they can find this. Hopefully they have good memories of me and if they do I hope this doesn’t change anything. But maybe they’ll understand how broken and fucked up and mentally tortued I am and in shock intruge and amusment I hope they want a sequel.  ",

   "body": "# It's hard to connect all thoughts together, because I haven't shared them, so in the time of writing they come up in my mind.\n\nWhile walking, i awlays think (i'd say overthink). (I guess almost all doomers do so.) And in this moment, in the moment of thinking, my brain hurts, idk why as if he wants to find a solution. The reason i think? Because of my very good life, of course!\n\n**I. Bloomer**\n\nTo start with, i don't like my appearance, but i have to say, that in 7-13 years i was a \"chad\" despite being fat. I think in childhood you don't pay attention about your appearance. In the first class i was spanking a girl, so i loved her and so did she. But at the same time i was chatting with other girls on the internet. When I was 11-12 y.o., she said that i have to lose weight and it hurt me so I blocked her, but still was loving. In the class I was the smartest and funny. *\\[little conclusion -- it's all about your charisma, but it doesn't exist without believing in yourself, which stands on several pillars, like appearance and confidence and existing of things that you like doing (yep, it's common thing for you)\\]* BUT the most important thing is that I treated other people like shit -- made fun of them. (When i had sort of depression i always thought about this and wanted to apologize.) When it comes to new people I hesitate untill I'll know this person well. Then in 14 y.o. my father and mother divorced. It was in summer before i left school and went to lyceum. I have to note that my mama said, when i was 3-5 y.o. i said, that i don't like my father. Now i think that he gave me nothing. He is living with his mom (my grandma), sometimes working part-time. Almost always drink beer. And it also hurts me. But recently i had a dream, where i tried to help him. I see that if i don't go through i'll become like him.\n\n**II. Doomer**\n\nIn the lyceum there were new people. At the begining i acted like in previous school, tried to bully (only in the net). But i realized subconsciously that they are smart, but i wasn't, so i changed strategy and started to study.

I guess almost all doomers do so.  And in this moment, in the moment of thinking, my brain hurts, idk why as if he wants to find a solution. The reason i think? Because of my very good life, of course!\n\n**I. Bloomer**\n\nTo start with, i don't like my appearance, but i have to say, that in 7-13 years i was a \"chad\" despite being fat. I think in childhood you don't pay attention about your appearance. In the first class i was spanking a girl, so i loved her and so did she. But at the same time i was chatting with other girls on the internet. When I was 11-12 y.o., she said that i have to lose weight and it hurt me so I blocked her, but still was loving. In the class I was the smartest and funny. *\\ little conclusion -- it's all about your charisma, but it doesn't exist without believing in yourself, which stands on several pillars, like appearance and confidence and existing of things that you like doing  yep, it's common thing for you \\ * BUT the most important thing is that I treated other people like shit -- made fun of them.  When i had sort of depression i always thought about this and wanted to apologize.  When it comes to new people I hesitate untill I'll know this person well. Then in 14 y.o. my father and mother divorced. It was in summer before i left school and went to lyceum. I have to note that my mama said, when i was 3-5 y.o. i said, that i don't like my father. Now i think that he gave me nothing. He is living with his mom  my grandma , sometimes working part-time. Almost always drink beer. And it also hurts me. But recently i had a dream, where i tried to help him. I see that if i don't go through i'll become like him.\n\n**II. Doomer**\n\nIn the lyceum there were new people. At the begining i acted like in previous school, tried to bully  only in the net . But i realized subconsciously that they are smart, but i wasn't, so i changed strategy and started to study. Nevertheless, sometimes when i felt that they are weak and im strong i made fun of them. All in all, i couldn't appreciate friends. I treated them like shit. So in the first class of the lyceum  14 y.o.  i had few friends. At the end i had 0.

   "title": "You will never be happy.",
   "body": "What the title says. A lot of you here might not have good jobs, lots of friends, fulfilling relationships, etc. but its not like you'd be any happier if you did. You know it. You'd stay miserable either way. A lot of miserable people have all of those, but still blow their brains out because something that doesn't change no matter how poor or rich you are is that life is suffering (still more so for the poor though, of course). With how suffering seems to be a feature of Life\\^TM and not just a bug, and especially considering the state of society, I could not blame anyone for shooting themselves even though they might have the world. \n\nThen is happiness a goal worthy of being pursued anyway? Is it not just an illusion? Don't we always say that everyone fights their own demons and even though they might not have noticed it yet, are always trying to get over the suffering and pain they wouldn't even experience had they not been born? Even those that seem happy, are, just like us, experiencing the pointless pains and numerous uncomfortabilities (if that's even a word) of life. Why those people can function like proper human beings while some others cannot is not a question I'm nearly qualified to even wonder about, the answer to that probably lies somewhere in the expertise of a psychologist/psychiatrist/whatever. (And yes, this is your reminder to stop treating memes and vidya as therapy and visit a fucking mental health professional.)\n\nAnyway, back to the question posed at the beginning of the paragraph above. To answer that question, we have to understand what happiness even means, right? And we know that we understand happiness not in its own right, but as we experience it relative to a person, because happiness in its own right doesn't exist; it only really exists when someone experiences it. Then, the question we have to answer is no longer \"What is happiness?\", it is \"Who is happy?\"\n\nWell then, who is happy? In answering this question it's good to take outliers out of the equation. The 1%, Buddhist ascetic monks, hermits that have dedicated their life to God, etc. are people that I will not be considering, because most people on this sub are just everyday, average people. Who among us ordinary people is happy? Now, our question has become easy to answer. Because the ordinary, average person, is undoubtedly not happy (everyone has flashes of happiness in their life, some people more than others, but consistent happiness is definitely so rare it doesn't even warrant being mentioned). Bosses that value cents over their employees' lives, a planet that will soon boil alive, corrupt politicians on every turn that value their power over anything else... It's hard not to be depressed, even before we count in the inherent pains of having to wake up every morning and keep choking on this smoggy air of life that no product but a noose can help sanitize. \n\nThen if happiness seems like such an unreachable goal, even for normal people, is it any wise to set it as a target? Normal people don't seem to have made it their life goal to \"finally be happy\" or \"ascend\" or whatever terminology you might use, they don't really care.  They just live. They do what they feel like doing, they go with their heart. I don't mean this in a \"The average person is dumb and doesn't follow logic or rationality, but their feelings\" way, because average people do of course follow their rationality and logic, but they use those as means towards their ends, like we all do. Their ends being, well, whatever they **want** to do.\n\nAnd its this \"want\" that I want to focus on. To \"want\" something is to love it. The normal person loves things. They **directly** desire and work towards a cornucopia of things, none of which are abstract concepts like \"happiness\". Happiness sometimes comes with those goals, sometimes it doesn't. They do things not necessarily because it will make them happy, but because they **love**. They love money, friends, social interaction, sex, God, music, science, work, whatever. And they will do whatever is in their power to get them. Not because doing so will \"finally make them happy\" but because they just like it. It's that simple.\n\nSo often I see on this sub that someone wants \"happiness\". Happiness doesn't fucking exist. It's not a thing that you can just put your hand on and have it be yours. That is fantasy. What does exist, is love. And what normal people experience, isn't happiness, it's love. Ask yourself, what do you love? \n\nI've made it my life mission to love things. It's simultaneously the easiest and hardest thing someone can do. This ugly, its-face-not-even-a-mother-could-love monstrosity called \"life\" is one of the most difficult things to appreciate and affirm. But every day, I wake up, stare at my ceiling then realize I'm alive, and grab the rose by the thorns. You don't have to do the same, and I really don't care what you do, because my attitude towards things will remain unchanged, but this is what has helped me and continues to help me.\n\nAs finishing thoughts, I know this post is very pretentious and self-absorbed and unhelpful, but I don't really care. When I have thoughts I wanna share, I just share them and that's it. That's what I love doing. I won't be responding to any possible comments. This is a throwaway, and after I hit enter here, I'm just going to log onto my main account and forget about this post till I login to this account again, God knows when. \n\nEnglish is not my first language, and I'm not sorry for any errors I've made.

   "title": "GTA 5 is the ultimate doomer game",
   "body": "This game brings back so many memories for me. I remember I'd played GTA as a 13 year old back in 2018 and I didn't understand enough about crime or what was going on in this game that it just flew over my head and I was happy to just shoot people and stuff, eventually I got bored and gave it to my cousin. But sometime around December 2019, I got interested in trying it out again and got it back from him. I remember it was the holidays and I'd just played a gig at the Christmas show at school with my band and I went into the holiday with a good feeling. I don't know what clicked for me with this game but it clicked hard, I spent that whole month of December playing GTA ALL DAY from 11 AM to 2 AM. January 2020 came and I found that I still really enjoyed playing it, plus the songs on the in-game radio stations were really growing on me. As if that weren't good enough, I came into 2020 with that good new-year feeling that I think everyone had in the first three months of 2020 and that only made gaming more enjoyable.\n\nThroughout January and February, I kept on playing GTA cause it was still so fun since there's so much you can do in the game and the map is huge too. During this time, everything in my life was improving significantly. My relationship with my friends was at the highest it'd ever been (I remember we started hanging out more like going to the mall and singing ROXANNE at night on the way home), I had this great game that I could come home from school to and really enjoy, my grades were starting to improve (I was a huge slacker before this), I'd moved to a nice new apartment that I really liked and everything in life was just going my way. What was even better, near the end of February I'd started talking to one of my upperclassmen who I'd had a huge crush on but never spoke to until then and I asked her out and we started dating in March 2nd - 6th (don't remember exactly when but whatever). So here I was, the happiest I'd ever been, having fun with friends, performing well academically, and now I have a girlfriend. Life couldn't get better and GTA 5 was right in the background of all of that. I'd listen to songs from GTA with my friends at school, I'd come home from my (then)girlfriend's apartment and hop on GTA. I think that's where my emotional connection for this game grew. What really sealed the bond though, was the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nEven thinking about the second half of March 2020 is gonna give me bad memories. I \"adjusted\" to the pandemic horribly from March to April, my grades which were on a steady incline completely plummeted in a matter of a week into lockdown; while we'd only known each other for 3 weeks, I felt the connection with my girlfriend starting to fade since we couldn't see each other in person or in school; my friends didn't care about school either and got too busy gaming on their own to keep active conversations on instagram. In the end, all I had left was music and GTA. So I put on the smiths and the cranberries, set the weather in GTA to thunder, and just drove. This was the first time I ever had that doomer feeling (I should tell you that while I don't exactly identify as a doomer, there's times when I find comfort in it and this time was the first ever). I found out a while ago that this is called maladaptive daydreaming, where you find something repetitive to do while you think about things, usually fantasies about how you want your life to be. In my case, I just wanted to have my normal life back. But being in that virtual world gave me an unbelievable amount of comfort that I started pretending that I lived there and I'd pick certain spots throughout the map to role play as my school and another place would be my friend's house and I'd pretend that my life was there. But the main reason I played GTA was for that driving-with-no-clear-destination feeling. I remember one time near the end of March when I was calling with my (then)girlfriend and we were able to have nice long conversations and I'd be driving in GTA in the nice orange sunset. That right there was one of the moments in early lockdown where I could really feel relaxed and not feel like shit every hour of the day. This driving while listening to music/calling people continued up until April and May when I eventually started to get bored of GTA. I was ready to stop playing. I'd had a great 5-6 months playing it and I didn't force it and stopped playing when I felt like it. I was ready to let it go and move on to other games.\n\nFlashing forward a year to May 2021, things didn't work out with my (now)ex, I still rarely talk to my old friends, and my grades have only slightly improved. One day, I was going through the closet looking for my skate tool and saw a box of old stuff. I went through it and I saw, low and behold, GTA in this dusty box from when we moved out of the apartment at the start of this year. I saw it and I started remembering everything from last year. I figured \"Hey, I still have my PS4. Why don't we check it out?\" and so I loaded the game in. The moment I spawned in as Franklin and started driving through the city again, it was as if I'd travelled back in time, but now it felt different. It was the exact same game with the exact same weather customizations and the exact same vehicles, but something felt off. It felt super depressing. When I was driving through the city, it felt like a ghost town even though there were NPCs running around in it. This place where I'd once gotten absolute joy from in the pre-corona months, and where I found solace in one of the worst times of my life, now felt...I don't even know how to describe it. It's crazy how a sunset in a game at one point of your life can make you feel so happy and that same sunset in another point of your life can make you feel so isolated. It's like I was playing the game but the screen was at the end of a tunnel, like I was playing with a dolly zoom on, every time I drove through one of the streets it was like I was a ghost and I was watching my past self when he was still so happy and I'm trying to yell out at him but he can't hear me...\n\nCut to the present (July 2021)\n\nI stopped playing GTA a couple weeks after I found it in May (cause of school) and especially now because my brother's currently self-isolating in his apartment and he took the PS4 with him, but to be honest I can't wait to get it back when I can and hop on, because even through playing the game three times, I still can't help but love it every single time. All these situations happened at just the right time for me to have grown such an emotional connection to it. I've been seeing some signs recently of me starting to find closure with this whole pandemic (closure as in a positive attitude, not just a whatever feeling which I've had through most of the pandemic), whether it's me getting vaccinated or my friends starting to be more active in conversations and literally planning events, or me being able to continue my relationship with my ex as friends, I've started seeing a small bit of hope. I look forward to its growth.\n\nI just wanna thank Rockstar Games for making GTA 5 because at this point, it's quite possibly my favorite game ever. The experiences I've had with it are second to no other and I'm so glad it exists and I hope other people will be able to find a game that really relaxes them and gives them emotional shelter like GTA 5 has to me. Thank you for reading all of this if you did, I hope you can take something positive out of it.\n\ntl;dr: gta 5 is the best doomer game because you can simulate your perfect doomer environment. You can drive in any car, control the time and weather, you have a huge map to explore and it's the perfect game to mindlessly play while you think about things in your life.",

I was ready to let it go and move on to other games.\n\nFlashing forward a year to May 2021, things didn't work out with my  now ex, I still rarely talk to my old friends, and my grades have only slightly improved. One day, I was going through the closet looking for my skate tool and saw a box of old stuff. I went through it and I saw, low and behold, GTA in this dusty box from when we moved out of the apartment at the start of this year. I saw it and I started remembering everything from last year. I figured \"Hey, I still have my PS4. Why don't we check it out?\" and so I loaded the game in. The moment I spawned in as Franklin and started driving through the city again, it was as if I'd travelled back in time, but now it felt different. It was the exact same game with the exact same weather customizations and the exact same vehicles, but something felt off. It felt super depressing. When I was driving through the city, it felt like a ghost town even though there were NPCs running around in it. This place where I'd once gotten absolute joy from in the pre-corona months, and where I found solace in one of the worst times of my life, now felt...I don't even know how to describe it. It's crazy how a sunset in a game at one point of your life can make you feel so happy and that same sunset in another point of your life can make you feel so isolated. It's like I was playing the game but the screen was at the end of a tunnel, like I was playing with a dolly zoom on, every time I drove through one of the streets it was like I was a ghost and I was watching my past self when he was still so happy and I'm trying to yell out at him but he can't hear me...\n\nCut to the present  July 2021 \n\nI stopped playing GTA a couple weeks after I found it in May  cause of school  and especially now because my brother's currently self-isolating in his apartment and he took the PS4 with him, but to be honest I can't wait to get it back when I can and hop on, because even through playing the game three times, I still can't help but love it every single time. All these situations happened at just the right time for me to have grown such an emotional connection to it. I've been seeing some signs recently of me starting to find closure with this whole pandemic  closure as in a positive attitude, not just a whatever feeling which I've had through most of the pandemic , whether it's me getting vaccinated or my friends starting to be more active in conversations and literally planning events, or me being able to continue my relationship with my ex as friends, I've started seeing a small bit of hope. I look forward to its growth.\n\nI just wanna thank Rockstar Games for making GTA 5 because at this point, it's quite possibly my favorite game ever. The experiences I've had with it are second to no other and I'm so glad it exists and I hope other people will be able to find a game that really relaxes them and gives them emotional shelter like GTA 5 has to me. Thank you for reading all of this if you did, I hope you can take something positive out of it.\n\ntl;dr: gta 5 is the best doomer game because you can simulate your perfect doomer environment. You can drive in any car, control the time and weather, you have a huge map to explore and it's the perfect game to mindlessly play while you think about things in your life. https://www.reddit.com/r/doomer/comments/ou3hss/gta_5_is_the_ultimate_doomer_game/",

Waking up and finding who the real Aubrey is - the sweet little (kinda flirty) girl who you once knew , is now a dickhead and that Kel isn't as annoying as in (idk what it's called, pls no spoilers) the dream realm? (Again I have no idea what it's called). And after giving back Basil's photo album and seeing that everything in the pics actually happened made me almost cry.\n\nI however kinda spoiled my game by looking up omori  on Google to see what platforms its on. I read the description and I spoiled a bit, but - Omori Is apparently Sunny's alter ego/dream world self?\n\nNow. The game tells me that about 4 years have passed and Sunny hasn't left the house, and apparently Mari is dead. So did Sunny stay in his house grieving over her death?

All games that I have played keep the depressing real shit for last, but the fact this game pulls it off in the first 3 / 4 hours is amazing.\n\nI just got past the \"Three days left\" and my god is it fucking depressing. Waking up and finding who the real Aubrey is - the sweet little  kinda flirty  girl who you once knew , is now a dickhead and that Kel isn't as annoying as in  idk what it's called, pls no spoilers  the dream realm?  Again I have no idea what it's called . And after giving back Basil's photo album and seeing that everything in the pics actually happened made me almost cry.\n\nI however kinda spoiled my game by looking up omori  on Google to see what platforms its on. I read the description and I spoiled a bit, but - Omori Is apparently Sunny's alter ego/dream world self?\n\nNow. The game tells me that about 4 years have passed and Sunny hasn't left the house, and apparently Mari is dead. So did Sunny stay in his house grieving over her death?

   "title": "Music Appreciation Post 1",
   "body": "If anyone here is like me, they probably have a playlist or two of music from OMORI. The music in this game is great, there’s no doubt about that. It has subtle, ambient nuance when needed, along with high energy battle and boss themes, and sometimes hits you over the head with a sack of emotional bricks.\n\nNow, I’ll preface this by saying I’m no music expert, but I feel like I know enough to at least get some thoughts out there about why OMORI’s music is so good. So I thought I might start a mini-series of posts about appreciating some of the songs I particularly enjoy. If you want to add to whatever I say, or perhaps suggest another song for a future post, feel free to do so in the comments, and I will try to get to them at some point in this series.\n\nBut, without further ado, let’s start with the first song you hear when booting up the game: Title. I’ll also be mentioning the post-good-ending title theme, Do You Remember?, for comparison purposes.\n\nTitle and Do You Remember? effectively act as bookends for the entire game. Title is the first song you ever hear, and Do You Remember? replaces it after beating the game (until you start another run, but that’s irrelevant at the moment). Both songs are based on the same leitmotif, which features some lonely piano notes, as if they’re meant to be accompanied by something else (and those who have beaten the game know exactly what should be accompanying the piano).\n\nTitle’s version of the leitmotif feels a little more hesitant than Do You Remember?, and maybe my ear for this isn’t the best, but it seems to be sample piano noises, as opposed to an actual piano, implying a “fakeness”. Those sounds are accompanied by subtle background noise, sort of like a droning, along with wind. It creates a very empty feeling, playing off the emptiness of the piano melody. The song is indicative of the emptiness of depression, with the wind noises sort of feeling like you’re standing alone on a precipice. As it plays on the main menu, you are, in fact, on a precipice: about to leap headfirst into Headspace for an adventure as Omori. The subtle droning noise beneath the wind creates a little bit of tension as the song starts up, which erodes away when the piano melody starts and the wind overpowers the droning. It’s as if, even though lonely, and even though it’s “fake”, the piano melody brings a degree of comfort, helping to cover up that droning noise of something being wrong. The droning is still there, the whole time, but just covered up as long as the song plays (which isn’t very long, as it’s only a little over 30 seconds), much like how depression and trauma never really go away completely.\n\nNow, onward to Do You Remember?, as a comparison. It now sounds like an actual piano, as you see Sunny, rather than his fake self, Omori. The droning noise is gone, as is the wind, indicative of Sunny having taken a key first step towards moving forward past the trauma. The piano melody is pure, and feels like it’s played with more power somehow. It’s as if Title was tapped out, but Do You Remember? is played with full emotion. The first title screen was a “fake” comfort, like Headspace itself, but after the ending, the new song is filled with the love of his friends, along with that of his sister. It’s no longer tainted, as he is moving past his guilt, and finally feels like he deserves the love he’s been given.\n\nIt’s a small change between Title and Do You Remember?, but indicative of how subtle the nuance can be sometimes in OMORI’s music. Both are the same leitmotif, and barely over 30 seconds long. But the more you listen, the more you realize how different the two songs are, and the more you come to appreciate that even this title screen song shows Sunny’s growth. As mentioned earlier, the songs bookend the game: Title is the first you hear, and then, after beating the game, when it sends you back to the title screen, you receive Do You Remember?, as a reward for helping Sunny, and the conclusion to Sunny’s journey.\n\nSo it seems I can’t make any posts without rambling walls of text, lol. My next music post (if I do another one) will probably be about my favorite set of melodies: all four versions of A Home For Flowers, but who knows when I’ll get to that. I just wanted to get this one out here first. If you read this far, thank you~! And feel free to make suggestions or generate discussion in the comments.",

   "title": "My experience with this game + an unoriginal sketch",
   "body": "This game has really struck a chord with me. I only played it a few weeks ago, but it's easily now one of, if not my favorite game ever. I first saw it on Xbox game pass when scrolling through all the games, and the cover really resonated with me. It took me a while to get around to playing the game, and I even kinda forgot about it for a while. But recently my depression has been pretty bad, and when looking through my games list, Omori's empty face felt perfectly descriptive of how I felt/feel. I went into the game blind. I assumed that it was about depression, and I wasn't wrong per day, but there's much more to it than that. Now I can't relate to having pushed my sister down the stairs and the trauma resulting from such (thankfully), but I do heavily relate to a lot of the themes in the game. The depression, anxiety, SH, suicidal thoughts, and self-hatred, are all things I deal with and the way they're portrayed felt so real to me. I swear, in the final battle against Omori when he's talking to sunny, those all felt like things that have gone through my head numerous times. It made me tear up a little whilst playing. I truly felt like I could relate to Sunny (nevermind the fact that we're the same age and share the exact birthday), in a way I've never felt before. I've grown to love all of the characters (minus Sweetheart), and even the idea of Headspace feels so familiar. I barely have any friends or social interaction (hooray for homeschooling!), so this idea of having a world in your head loosely inspired by reality, that's very similar to what I did during COVID, and to a lesser extent still do. I just love this game so much. I don't think I've ever experienced something so simultaneously heartwarming and depressing before. And the music, oh my, I'm listening to 'By Your Side' while writing this even, the entire soundtrack is just incredible. Ironically though, I can't tell whether Omori is helping my depression or making it worse. On the one hand I absolutely adore this game, and I feel almost understood by it, no piece of media that I've consumed before has portrayed the things I feel as well as Omori. But on the other hand, after building such a strong connection with these characters, seeing the friendship they have, the loneliness seeps back in. I dunno, I just yearn for that so badly. Regardless, this game means a lot to me, and I am so so grateful that I've been able to enjoy it.\nSorry for the long-ramble.",

   "merged_text": "My experience with this game + an unoriginal sketch This game has really struck a chord with me. I only played it a few weeks ago, but it's easily now one of, if not my favorite game ever. I first saw it on Xbox game pass when scrolling through all the games, and the cover really resonated with me. It took me a while to get around to playing the game, and I even kinda forgot about it for a while. But recently my depression has been pretty bad, and when looking through my games list, Omori's empty face felt perfectly descriptive of how I felt/feel. I went into the game blind. I assumed that it was about depression, and I wasn't wrong per day, but there's much more to it than that. Now I can't relate to having pushed my sister down the stairs and the trauma resulting from such  thankfully , but I do heavily relate to a lot of the themes in the game. The depression, anxiety, SH, suicidal thoughts, and self-hatred, are all things I deal with and the way they're portrayed felt so real to me. I swear, in the final battle against Omori when he's talking to sunny, those all felt like things that have gone through my head numerous times. It made me tear up a little whilst playing. I truly felt like I could relate to Sunny  nevermind the fact that we're the same age and share the exact birthday , in a way I've never felt before. I've grown to love all of the characters  minus Sweetheart , and even the idea of Headspace feels so familiar. I barely have any friends or social interaction  hooray for homeschooling! , so this idea of having a world in your head loosely inspired by reality, that's very similar to what I did during COVID, and to a lesser extent still do. I just love this game so much. I don't think I've ever experienced something so simultaneously heartwarming and depressing before. And the music, oh my, I'm listening to 'By Your Side' while writing this even, the entire soundtrack is just incredible. Ironically though, I can't tell whether Omori is helping my depression or making it worse. On the one hand I absolutely adore this game, and I feel almost understood by it, no piece of media that I've consumed before has portrayed the things I feel as well as Omori. But on the other hand, after building such a strong connection with these characters, seeing the friendship they have, the loneliness seeps back in. I dunno, I just yearn for that so badly.

   "body": "First of all, no, I am not going to highlight anything about the game by saying that it is a masterpiece of psychology and I will not look for symbolism where there is none, I will not hesitate to highlight the bad points of the game, although I will try to take into account the good things ...so you could say I'm a hater\n\nAnd since I'm a hater, if you want you can ignore what I'll say and just go down and give me the downvote that I deserve for not having the opinion of the majority or for not understanding the super ultra deep and super giga mega realistic psychology of the game, now lets start:\n\nAh... Omori, the 99999 indie RPG videogame inspired by Earthbound made in RPG maker, I won't mention the exaggerated production time of 6 years (because come on, in RPG maker you can literally make a videogame in 2 days) \n\nthe things that most attracts my attention are: the plot, which is 50/50 for me due to the plot holes that not even the fandom can explain no matter how many mental jerks they made, the characters, the narrative, the structure of the game/Gameplay and the controversies of Omocat ...which I'm not going to include because I feel like it would be very unfair to the game's opportunity to defend itself. \n\n•Plot: I must say that... I liked it, yeah, I found it sentimental and everything, but just because a game makes you cry doesn't make it a masterpiece, it just means that you became very attached to it. The plot, looking at it more closely, is very disastrous, I must say that the idea of a child who becomes a hermint (or as they call it here: hikkikomori) due to a trauma he had 4 years ago for killing his big sister, and that before moving out he goes out to see what's up with his friends and seeing that his mistake made everyone's life miserable, is a plot that would be very interesting... but we are going wrong in some things, first: the cover-up of Mari's death. I have many thoughts with this scene, because the presentation is very good, I like how they used the film technique of \"showing and not telling\" narrating everything with the photos, making it clear what happened, but still leaving some mysteries like... What did Sunny and Mari discuss? What was Sunny and Basil's first reactions? and others like that... but nothing is perfect and there are also errors. The scene stops being good after Sunny kills Mari, because I must say that it was a very creative way to put the burden of killing a loved one on Sunny's shoulders, *but* everything goes to hell when they cover it up by hanging her. .. I mean... why didn't they call an ambulance? Why didn't they say that she tripped on her broken knee while she was holding the violin and she fell on it? At 12 years old it is an age in which it is unlikely to think of something as crazy as hanging someone and on top of that knowing how to tie a hangman's knot, and I know they are going to defend this by saying that they were just scared children and all, but tell me your ...if you were in the same situation, would you do the same?   \n\nEverything continues to get worse with the fact that everyone swallows that lie, I mean... did everyone care that Mari had fall injuries? Well, apparently no... and they simply accepted the idea that she killed herself, and let's not even talk about the apparent nonexistence of the police in the game, because with a single autopsy, Sunny and Basil's entire plan would fell down, and yes, I see you writing that they made that whole mess because they were *scared little kids and I don't know what and memememe*... I mean, bro... justify all this by saying that \"they were just scared kids\" it even seems like a comedy (it makes me laugh a little that when the characters are 12 years old, they act as if they were 8, and when they are 16, they act as if they were 12 lol) in my mind I proposed to fix things (in a slightly cheap way, but in my opinion better) and it is that they would call an ambulance, and while they are in a hospital room there with Sunny's friends, seeing Mari dead, obviously sad, a policeman interrogates Basil to find out what's up with everything, and Basil, under the pressure of the interrogation, he invents the stupidity that Mari killed herself by jumping from the second floor (which I think would make sense due to the injuries from the fall) and that the police did not buy it and decided to investigate further, but that the others trust, because Basil would have a reputation for not lie, and with this the scene where Sunny tells the truth would have a little more symbolism, because the lie would end right where it started: in the hospital   \n\nbut hey, we are criticizing Omori, not making fanficts, right? anyway...   \n\n•Characters: well, let's start with the protagonist, the fandom's favorite TraumaBoy: Sunny. I don't know how to feel about Sunny (nah its a lie, I hate this guy to death). Firstly, his attitude, Sunny is the greatest romanticization of depression and introverts that I have ever seen, with his exaggeratedly reserved attitude that would not last any second in real life, with his clothing which is designed solely to expose his body as much as possible with the intention of attracting degenerate shotacon fans, and the fact that they use the biggest cliche of depressed people: carrying a knife everywhere for no reason. Sunny shows no interest in helping his friends or getting Aubrey back into the group, and what's more... he even hurts them, like when he stabbed Aubrey (yes, I know it's because he was far away from reality at that moment and blah blah blah) but Sunny seems very proud of having given a knife wound to whoever is apparently his crush, and here we have another absence from the police force, because no one in the park deigned to call the police. authorities, and we are even worse with his psychopath behavior, like when he cut open Mewo apparently for pleasure, or the simple fact that he decided to carry a knife in the first place (I mean... why?) and yes, I know that isolation It can cause psychopathy but if Sunny really loved his friends so much, to the point of having a fantasy world where he has adventures with them, he should show them a little empathy, right?...right...?  \n\nWe are also bad with the fact that he is... very selfish.  \n\nHe was selfish since he hanged his own sister that he \"loved a lot\" just to save himself, he was selfish by leaving Basil hallucinating in the bathroom, and he is selfish with the simple fact that... well, Sunny doesn't seem to like being with his friends, he always seems bitter and barely plays with them, and if Sunny doesn't like being alone, technically he would just want company to satisfy that personal emptiness, but not in an empathetic way because he only wants people around him for his pleasure... which as I said... is a bit selfish.  \n\nLet's not even talk about how he is immeasurably stoic, he doesn't smile, and not because of some illness, he literally says that he never liked to smile, he says it so clearly and directly that it would be funny to interpret it in another way... and yes, I see you writing that thing about him being autistic... no, Sunny is not autistic, that is a headcanon that you took from some body orifice, because that is not canon, let's remember that autism is delays in some mental aspects such as speech, thinking, expressions... and Sunny does not present any of those symptoms (just that he does not speak) and if he really were autistic, it would be more of an excuse to justify his behavior than because they really wanted to make an autistic character, and I know you will tell me that \"autistic people don't like to smile in photos\", but this is a backfire very very strong, because Basil said that he likes to take photos when no one is looking to capture \"their natural behavior\", at some point he had to catch Sunny with a smile, right?. If I'm honest, Sunny gives me more vibes of being emo, I mean... come on, he always dressed in black (even before the incident) he never smiles by choice, he is always serious, he carries a knife for no reason... come on bro... he is shouting from the rooftops that he is an emo, besides, when I see his face I don't feel that he is sad, nor depressed, nor sleepy, he seems rather \"bored\" or one of those people who say \"meh\" to everything. \n\nAnd this fandom makes me laugh if I'm honest, with people who say they identify with Sunny... I mean... it's possible to identify with this empty character? come on... if anyone bothered to read this, tell me ...how do you identify with Sunny? that are you a dwarf? that you are paler than Samara Morgan? that you carry a knife for no reason? that you are bitter just because? that you are a burden to your friends? that you are selfish? that everything scare you?   \nokay okay, im sorry... I'm being very harsh, but come on, this is true, if I ask you why you like Sunny, most likely you'll say it's because you feel bad for him or because his design is cute, but that's a very vague reason to like a character, and it only confirms that he's terribly written. If I asked someone here why they like Sunny, they'd probably just say it's because he looks cute and because he suffered a lot, but other than that... do you think he'd be a good friend? an empty person who barely speaks and barely comes out to play with you? It is very clear that Sunny got his friends because of Mari, not because of him, because Sunny has no charm other than acting like a generic introverted anime character, which, as I said: it wouldn't last any second in real life.   \n\nBut this is all good, right? Because it's supposed to be a story about someone who made a mistake and is redeeming himself, and it's understandable that he's despicable if that's the intention... right?   \n\nno, unfortunately not.   \n\nthe game desperately tries to make you feel bad for Sunny, when he faces his guilt in the final battle the game treats it as something sad, when he matures it treats it as something sad, and even when he tells the truth it treats it as something sad. None of this is sad, it's something that Sunny had to go through and it's not sad, it's a moment of will and determination, why the hell are you playing that bittersweet piano music for me? It should have uplifting music because Sunny for the first time in his miserable life does something morally correct. The game would be fine if it made it clear to us that Sunny is responsible for everything and that he knows it, and that he must mature to face what he did... but no, the game treats him as if he were the victim of everything, which it obviously is not; I highly doubt that his friends will forgive him after telling the truth, because... let's be honest, no one would react calmly to a such bucket of cold water, and I even think that since Sunny confessed what happened, he would even go to jail, he I would move on, but move on the road to the correctional facility lmao (I can already imagine Metroman telling him: \"going somewhere, besides jail?). Wow, Sunny almost stole this part, right? Well, let's talk about the stereotypical tomboy bully: Aubrey (or Auby as they call her here) I liked her, yeah, I liked her, her version of Headspace made me very very *very* cringe but the Faraway one seemed like a complete 180° turn that I liked, she was rude, violent, and obviously they presented her as a villain, without ridiculous justifications... or well that's what I thought, because after Sunny let out his inner beast and attacked her, her next appearance at the church left a bad taste in my mouth. Let's see... Everything is fine until the parishioners start criticizing her; I am a Christian, and it doesn't bother me that they represent us as villains, for example: I loved the character of Claude Frollo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but here? religious fanaticism is handled in such a poor way that I even have doubts if Omocat put it in because he has something against the church, because the dialogues and whispers that were thrown at Aubrey were very \"XD\"... I mean, for example:   \n\n\"Even since her father left, she is so uncontrollable, disrespectful, I feel bad for her mother\"   \n\nI mean... bro, did you just say that her father abandoned her and you proceed to criticize her? I mean... I know we are hypocrites but not that much lol. And as always, there is never a shortage of those who say that \\*this is very very very very realistic, that it is more realistic than the graphics of an RTX just because it is by Omori and that it is a masterpiece and I don't know what and mememememe\\*. But anyway, the character declines more when on the last day, we go to her house and I'm supposed to feel bad for her difunctional home... I mean, yes, of course it makes me sad to see someone living like that in the real life, but in Omori, this seems more like a way to make Aubrey look misunderstood make you forgive her actions, and it gets worse when with an intervention by Kel, Sunny and Hero in her room (or rather attic) Aubrey becomes part of the group apparently with the \"power of friendship\", I mean... bruh. If I were Aubrey, and the people I had a grudge against for 4 years broke into my house, the first thing I would do would be grab my nail bat and threat them; Ahhh but that doesn't matter because this is a symbolism of I don't know what in real life and that's why it's very realistic and I don't know what and mememememe. I have no problems with Kel, Hero and Basil, or at least none worth mentioning. The only character I really liked was Mari, and she's honestly my favorite; I never had an older sister, I was the first child and I have a younger sister, and I identify with her in trying to be outstanding and responsible (Yeah! I'm a boy who identifies with a girl character, any problem?), although hey, we are not talking about my life.   \nI admit it, I cried a little in Final Duet, but not for Sunny, but for Mari, you can see that she was a very good person and Sunny, in his selfishness, killed her, Mari also has her blunders (like when she overexploited Sunny with the violin) but it is clear that she always had good intentions and although it ended in tragedy, she just wanted her brother to stop being so lazy, which is something very justifiable. And I feel bad for her since her reputation and memory was stained by Sunny in his selfish attempt to save himself (because yes, Sunny regretted killing her but I don't see that he regretted hanging her) and well... nothing more to say here.   \n\n•Narrative: well, we already burned the characters a lot... now let's move on to the narrative, which is honestly regrettable at a certain point. Remember when I said at the beginning that I liked how in the revelation of how Mari died they used the \"show and don't tell\" technique? Well, everything goes to waste now, because it's the only time the game narrates something well. Let's put everything on the table: you just got out of the fight with Aubrey in the church I already talked about, then you go to the cementery and see Mari's grave, you get close and a cutscene activates, and then... SURPRISE! now Kel will tell you the whole old testament about how Hero got depressed and locked himself up for 1 year, I mean... this is too anticlimactic, during the whole scene I didn't feel bad for Hero or Kel, I was just like: \"did I asked you?\" and that is a problem with the game, they threw away the \"show and don't tell\" thing and now they are with a \"tell and don't show\", yes it is true that this depressed Hero theme is too irrelevant to be worth it give it a cinematic, so it would be nice if instead of Kel telling you everything in a random and anticlimactic moment, it would be nice to have some hints from Kel's parents and some dialogue from Hero in some moment of trust alone with Sunny. And it's not just this one, it's also when at the end of day 1, we return the album to Basil and look at the photos, and in the photo where Sunny is playing with a Gameboy on the couch... SURPRISE! Now Basil tells you the whole 1000 nights of sodom and explains in that same photo how Sunny is actually just shy and lets people have vent with him and I don't know what and memememe. It's very easy for me to interpret that Sunny threatened Basil into writing something positive about him on the album... and come on, it's not hard to imagine him doing that. And I have to rely on these dialogues to think that Sunny is actually a good friend, but for me he doesn't even care that his friends \"vent\" with him... and why? Well, do you remember that scene with the swings on the last day? where Aubrey talks to Sunny? Well, while Aubrey tells her her sorrows, Sunny cares three hectares of beans and just swings, totally ignoring her; What difference would it make if in the past he didn't ignore them in the same way? while supposedly doing them a favor by listening to them? Having to rely on text boxes is something that bothers me, because the actions of the characters in the game tell me something else, and it's made worse by the way the game deals with suicide and depression. I must admit that the trauma is portrayed VERY WELL, but the suicide and depression is terrible here. First of all, let's go with the Suicide: well, it's like Sunny really likes to self-kill, right? I mean, he kills himself in white space every moment to wake up, and yes, it's okay that they wanted to bring up the topic that when we die in a dream, we wake up in real life, but why not make him wake up once every time those moments with Stranger or that he remembers something? instead of sending us to Whitespace to watch Omori stab himself? It seems a little too edgy to me, besides... when Sunny kills himself in real life, the game AGAIN does it just to feel sorry for him, both when he stabs himself in the neutral ending and when he jumps out of the hospital in the Bad ending , to me it feels very... meh, the fact that they romanticize suicide as some kind of lifestyle is very offensive to me if someone here really suffers from suicidal thoughts, I could even say that Sunny has a kind of paraphilia with stab himself in the stomach. And well, what about depression? It seems that they portrayed it with their feet, and I doubt that Omocat firstly investigated what depression was like before making the game, I mean... when Sunny tells the truth, his trauma, guilt, depression, anxiety and Basil's... just magically disappear. Bad there, depression and anxiety is very difficult to cure and is even incurable in some cases, I don't know what to say about Sunny's but Basil's? bruh... and I feel that the confession of the truth was counter-prudent because since everyone now knows what Sunny and Basil did... well, Sunny will move on but Basil is going to be left suffering Bullying assuming that they did not forgive them (which is the most acurrate) so Sunny would be abandoning Basil again lol.   \n\n•Gameplay: well well, we come to the gameplay, I think I won't say much here because there isn't much to address. What complaints do I have with the gameplay? Well, more than Gameplay, it is more the design of the game. Let's start with Headspace, Sunny's place of escapism, well... headspace is an excessive injection of cringe, it's too childish, and it would be fine if this were a children's video game, but Omori is a game with serious themes, it is a game intended to teenagers and young adults, I don't think anyone here would tell me that they enjoyed how they wasted time in that dream world that was supposed to amaze me; Being a world of escapism, I'm supposed to prefer this place, right? that I don't want to leave or at least enjoy it more than real life, but when I started a section of Headspace I was just desperate for it to finish and go back to playing some section of the real world, and the fact that the parts of Headspace are more long that the real world is something that kills the game a lot, in headspace I don't feel like I'm advancing at all, obviously I don't advance in the plot because it's a world of escapism, but I don't feel like I'm advancing in headspace either, I mean... I kill enemies, I watch Sweetheart's whims, I watch Mr. Jawsum's scams or whatever that shark's name is, I don't feel like I'm progressing at all, *ahhhh but this doesn't matter, right? because everything in headspace is a very very very very very realistic symbolism of I don't know what in real life and since it is like that then it is a such big great masterpiece because the symbolism matters more than making a good game and I don't know what and mememememe*\n\n Omocat had the freedom to do some crazy and fun adventure, something that was interesting and even memorable, but no... headspace literally makes you sleepy (and not kidding, literally, even with the music) although well this can be forgiven, right? Because since it is a lucid world of dreams, then it must make me want to sleep, right? *bada dum tss*   \n\nAnyway, Omori left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and not because of its story trying to be tragic, but because of giving me an experience that I will not want to re-play, it is a game, but not a good game, it is a story, but not a good story.\n   \nThe only things I really liked were the music (the piano and violin, the rest seem meh) and the artistic style, I thought it was cute   \n\nAnd as I already told you, you could have just ignored everything I said and just given me a downvote because I'm just a stupid hater who doesn't understand the *very very very very deep psychology of Omori and is not able to understand his very very very very elaborate realistic story and that's why Omori is the game of the year and I don't know what* (ok ok sorry, but I had to vent somehow). \n  \nIf you want a psychologic horror game that is *actually* scary and has a better executed moral of forgiving yourself, and that above all is fun to play, I recommend trying Silent Hill 2.   \n\nI hope in the next manga that they are going to launch, they correct the narrative and plot errors, it would be a bit dull if they only traced the story, wouldn't it?   \n\nhaha anyway, have a good day my dear gringos, take care of your towers ",

Omori, the 99999 indie RPG videogame inspired by Earthbound made in RPG maker, I won't mention the exaggerated production time of 6 years  because come on, in RPG maker you can literally make a videogame in 2 days  \n\nthe things that most attracts my attention are: the plot, which is 50/50 for me due to the plot holes that not even the fandom can explain no matter how many mental jerks they made, the characters, the narrative, the structure of the game/Gameplay and the controversies of Omocat ...which I'm not going to include because I feel like it would be very unfair to the game's opportunity to defend itself. \n\n•Plot: I must say that... I liked it, yeah, I found it sentimental and everything, but just because a game makes you cry doesn't make it a masterpiece, it just means that you became very attached to it. The plot, looking at it more closely, is very disastrous, I must say that the idea of a child who becomes a hermint  or as they call it here: hikkikomori  due to a trauma he had 4 years ago for killing his big sister, and that before moving out he goes out to see what's up with his friends and seeing that his mistake made everyone's life miserable, is a plot that would be very interesting... but we are going wrong in some things, first: the cover-up of Mari's death. I have many thoughts with this scene, because the presentation is very good, I like how they used the film technique of \"showing and not telling\" narrating everything with the photos, making it clear what happened, but still leaving some mysteries like... What did Sunny and Mari discuss? What was Sunny and Basil's first reactions? and others like that... but nothing is perfect and there are also errors. The scene stops being good after Sunny kills Mari, because I must say that it was a very creative way to put the burden of killing a loved one on Sunny's shoulders, *but* everything goes to hell when they cover it up by hanging her. .. I mean... why didn't they call an ambulance? Why didn't they say that she tripped on her broken knee while she was holding the violin and she fell on it? At 12 years old it is an age in which it is unlikely to think of something as crazy as hanging someone and on top of that knowing how to tie a hangman's knot, and I know they are going to defend this by saying that they were just scared children and all, but tell me your ...if you were in the same situation, would you do the same?   \n\nEverything continues to get worse with the fact that everyone swallows that lie, I mean... did everyone care that Mari had fall injuries? Well, apparently no... and they simply accepted the idea that she killed herself, and let's not even talk about the apparent nonexistence of the police in the game, because with a single autopsy, Sunny and Basil's entire plan would fell down, and yes, I see you writing that they made that whole mess because they were *scared little kids and I don't know what and memememe*... I mean, bro... justify all this by saying that \"they were just scared kids\" it even seems like a comedy  it makes me laugh a little that when the characters are 12 years old, they act as if they were 8, and when they are 16, they act as if they were 12 lol  in my mind I proposed to fix things  in a slightly cheap way, but in my opinion better  and it is that they would call an ambulance, and while they are in a hospital room there with Sunny's friends, seeing Mari dead, obviously sad, a policeman interrogates Basil to find out what's up with everything, and Basil, under the pressure of the interrogation, he invents the stupidity that Mari killed herself by jumping from the second floor  which I think would make sense due to the injuries from the fall  and that the police did not buy it and decided to investigate further, but that the others trust, because Basil would have a reputation for not lie, and with this the scene where Sunny tells the truth would have a little more symbolism, because the lie would end right where it started: in the hospital   \n\nbut hey, we are criticizing Omori, not making fanficts, right? anyway...   \n\n•Characters: well, let's start with the protagonist, the fandom's favorite TraumaBoy: Sunny. I don't know how to feel about Sunny  nah its a lie, I hate this guy to death . Firstly, his attitude, Sunny is the greatest romanticization of depression and introverts that I have ever seen, with his exaggeratedly reserved attitude that would not last any second in real life, with his clothing which is designed solely to expose his body as much as possible with the intention of attracting degenerate shotacon fans, and the fact that they use the biggest cliche of depressed people: carrying a knife everywhere for no reason.

Wow, Sunny almost stole this part, right? Well, let's talk about the stereotypical tomboy bully: Aubrey  or Auby as they call her here  I liked her, yeah, I liked her, her version of Headspace made me very very *very* cringe but the Faraway one seemed like a complete 180° turn that I liked, she was rude, violent, and obviously they presented her as a villain, without ridiculous justifications... or well that's what I thought, because after Sunny let out his inner beast and attacked her, her next appearance at the church left a bad taste in my mouth.

And I have to rely on these dialogues to think that Sunny is actually a good friend, but for me he doesn't even care that his friends \"vent\" with him... and why? Well, do you remember that scene with the swings on the last day? where Aubrey talks to Sunny? Well, while Aubrey tells her her sorrows, Sunny cares three hectares of beans and just swings, totally ignoring her; What difference would it make if in the past he didn't ignore them in the same way? while supposedly doing them a favor by listening to them? Having to rely on text boxes is something that bothers me, because the actions of the characters in the game tell me something else, and it's made worse by the way the game deals with suicide and depression. I must admit that the trauma is portrayed VERY WELL, but the suicide and depression is terrible here. First of all, let's go with the Suicide: well, it's like Sunny really likes to self-kill, right? I mean, he kills himself in white space every moment to wake up, and yes, it's okay that they wanted to bring up the topic that when we die in a dream, we wake up in real life, but why not make him wake up once every time those moments with Stranger or that he remembers something? instead of sending us to Whitespace to watch Omori stab himself? It seems a little too edgy to me, besides... when Sunny kills himself in real life, the game AGAIN does it just to feel sorry for him, both when he stabs himself in the neutral ending and when he jumps out of the hospital in the Bad ending , to me it feels very... meh, the fact that they romanticize suicide as some kind of lifestyle is very offensive to me if someone here really suffers from suicidal thoughts, I could even say that Sunny has a kind of paraphilia with stab himself in the stomach. And well, what about depression? It seems that they portrayed it with their feet, and I doubt that Omocat firstly investigated what depression was like before making the game, I mean... when Sunny tells the truth, his trauma, guilt, depression, anxiety and Basil's... just magically disappear. Bad there, depression and anxiety is very difficult to cure and is even incurable in some cases, I don't know what to say about Sunny's but Basil's? bruh... and I feel that the confession of the truth was counter-prudent because since everyone now knows what Sunny and Basil did... well, Sunny will move on but Basil is going to be left suffering Bullying assuming that they did not forgive them  which is the most acurrate  so Sunny would be abandoning Basil again lol.   \n\n•Gameplay: well well, we come to the gameplay, I think I won't say much here because there isn't much to address. What complaints do I have with the gameplay? Well, more than Gameplay, it is more the design of the game. Let's start with Headspace, Sunny's place of escapism, well... headspace is an excessive injection of cringe, it's too childish, and it would be fine if this were a children's video game, but Omori is a game with serious themes, it is a game intended to teenagers and young adults, I don't think anyone here would tell me that they enjoyed how they wasted time in that dream world that was supposed to amaze me; Being a world of escapism, I'm supposed to prefer this place, right? that I don't want to leave or at least enjoy it more than real life, but when I started a section of Headspace I was just desperate for it to finish and go back to playing some section of the real world, and the fact that the parts of Headspace are more long that the real world is something that kills the game a lot, in headspace I don't feel like I'm advancing at all, obviously I don't advance in the plot because it's a world of escapism, but I don't feel like I'm advancing in headspace either, I mean... I kill enemies, I watch Sweetheart's whims, I watch Mr. Jawsum's scams or whatever that shark's name is, I don't feel like I'm progressing at all, *ahhhh but this doesn't matter, right? because everything in headspace is a very very very very very realistic symbolism of I don't know what in real life and since it is like that then it is a such big great masterpiece because the symbolism matters more than making a good game and I don't know what and mememememe*\n\n Omocat had the freedom to do some crazy and fun adventure, something that was interesting and even memorable, but no... headspace literally makes you sleepy  and not kidding, literally, even with the music  although well this can be forgiven, right? Because since it is a lucid world of dreams, then it must make me want to sleep, right? *bada dum tss*   \n\nAnyway, Omori left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and not because of its story trying to be tragic, but because of giving me an experience that I will not want to re-play, it is a game, but not a good game, it is a story, but not a good story.\n   \nThe only things I really liked were the music  the piano and violin, the rest seem meh  and the artistic style, I thought it was cute   \n\nAnd as I already told you, you could have just ignored everything I said and just given me a downvote because I'm just a stupid hater who doesn't understand the *very very very very deep psychology of Omori and is not able to understand his very very very very elaborate realistic story and that's why Omori is the game of the year and I don't know what*  ok ok sorry, but I had to vent somehow . \n  \nIf you want a psychologic horror game that is *actually* scary and has a better executed moral of forgiving yourself, and that above all is fun to play, I recommend trying Silent Hill 2.   \n\nI hope in the next manga that they are going to launch, they correct the narrative and plot errors, it would be a bit dull if they only traced the story, wouldn't it?   \n\nhaha anyway, have a good day my dear gringos, take care of your towers  https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/18n2oim/my_dislikes_with_omori_long_post/",

I'm not going to try to comment on the specifics of the art style since I don't know anything about that but I know I loved it and cannot think of many other video games to compare it to. The music... wow what a surprise that was. The combination of catchy, almost bit-tune sounding music and also introducing instruments at apt times. I'm going to continuously listen to the soundtrack and I even have started playing it while I'm driving. Coincidentally I had a friend share a track from another video game and I instantly thought, \"Do I have something to show you!\"\n\nI could go on and on about the creative elements but I'll wrap things up talking about the emotional impact. This game's courageous choice to confront mental health, depression, facing your fears, and suicide... And to handle it with a seeming ample amount of grace... I only finished my playthrough recently (1/10/23) but I cannot stop thinking about this game. This was only compounded after I looked into the alternate endings. The story's ability to weave these themes in with what's experienced in Faraway and Headspace culminates in an unforgettable finish. I'm relieved to have gotten the Good Ending (no secret scene at the end unfortunately) and I would not have had it any other way for my first playthrough.\n\nIn short this game will go down as one of my favorites and certainly one of the most impactful. I would like to thank OMOCAT and co. for the love and care they put into Omori and I'll look forward to their next expert. I will certainly recommend Omori to anyone I can and I'm looking forward to spending some time on this Reddit talking about this special game. Thanks for listening!",

And at the same time they give him an opportunity much better and worse at the same time: to see their death and not to inflict consequences on himself.\n\n-Sunny just got away with it, and the only one who would suffer from it was himself. New city, new life, new friends to whom he couldn't tell he killed his sister and best friend. This ending had so much more of an emotional effect if we add meta to it. It's a major \"FUCK YOU\" letter from Omocat and others.\n\n The same way they hate people who don't respect the world of the game and let people just skip huge amounts of really valuable information,(e.g. Kel graveyard scene) they hate the completionism taken to absolute of just dont giving a fuck about characters and their feelings.\nThey make a device between what they perceived as healthy comletionism, because they pretty much respect people who loved the headspace and blackspace by giving them omori route, existence of which was obvious. But when a person has fallen enough for a content to both notice that you can sleep and actually click \"YES\" is where the game draws the line. That's also why 100% the game is so tidious and why so much people never do it. Some things are legitimately aren't supposed to happen, and this ending is a shining example.\n\nThe team never wanted you to be like that, and because of this - they made this ending. We can only fantasise about how Sunny kept living after moving out, but we can obviously say that the game intent was not to make this a worst ending. This ending just is gross because it makes you see a gore of little flower boy and then see Sunny being unnatural as fuck. But it sure makes YOU feel the worst about this ending. You are at fault. \nBut, hey, I might be wrong somewhere and obviously can't read onocats mind. And it's still just an interpretation and if you disagree I litteraly can't do anything about it.",

And at the same time they give him an opportunity much better and worse at the same time: to see their death and not to inflict consequences on himself.\n\n-Sunny just got away with it, and the only one who would suffer from it was himself. New city, new life, new friends to whom he couldn't tell he killed his sister and best friend. This ending had so much more of an emotional effect if we add meta to it. It's a major \"FUCK YOU\" letter from Omocat and others.\n\n The same way they hate people who don't respect the world of the game and let people just skip huge amounts of really valuable information, e.g. Kel graveyard scene  they hate the completionism taken to absolute of just dont giving a fuck about characters and their feelings.\nThey make a device between what they perceived as healthy comletionism, because they pretty much respect people who loved the headspace and blackspace by giving them omori route, existence of which was obvious. But when a person has fallen enough for a content to both notice that you can sleep and actually click \"YES\" is where the game draws the line. That's also why 100% the game is so tidious and why so much people never do it. Some things are legitimately aren't supposed to happen, and this ending is a shining example.\n\nThe team never wanted you to be like that, and because of this - they made this ending. We can only fantasise about how Sunny kept living after moving out, but we can obviously say that the game intent was not to make this a worst ending. This ending just is gross because it makes you see a gore of little flower boy and then see Sunny being unnatural as fuck. But it sure makes YOU feel the worst about this ending. You are at fault. \nBut, hey, I might be wrong somewhere and obviously can't read onocats mind. And it's still just an interpretation and if you disagree I litteraly can't do anything about it. https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/1b5w90h/severe_misunderstanding_of_uhm_abandonment_ending/",

   "title": "My Full in depth Omori Review (Major Spoilers!)",
   "body": "**Before I start: This review contains major spoilers for Omori’s main story. It's meant for people who finished at least the Sunny/True Route. I will write a separate post about the Omori/Neutral Route once I’ve played through it. If you haven't finished the game yet, please refrain from reading this review since it will ruin your experience.**\n\n**It goes without saying that this review gets pretty dark. If you’re still mentally recovering from playing Omori, I advice you to not read this review until you’re in a better place.**\n\nAlso, I have to clear something up first. I don’t wanna give this game any rating based on some random scale. Numbers can’t even remotely describe how much I like or dislike something. I believe a critique/rating can’t be summed up by numbers. Nonetheless, I hope you’ll enjoy this review!\n\n# Index:\n\n1. Gameplay\n2. Graphics and Artstyle\n3. Soundtrack\n4. Story\n5. Personal Thoughts & Opinions\n6. Conclusion\n\n# 1. Gameplay\n\n**Combat**\n\nI’m usually not a big fan of turn based RPGs. I need some level of interactivity or strategy for turn based combat to be interesting to me. Interactivity like timing your attacks by hitting a button. Or strategy like Omori’s emotion system. For me, it needs to be more than merely damage, heal, exploit weaknesses etc.\n\nI actually liked the combat of Omori very much. The emotion system isn’t just interesting by creating weaknesses and strengths. Each emotion comes with several effects like a higher chance of critical hits but also a higher chance of missing. And the fact that ANY character can feel ANY emotion makes this so much better. A fight can turn from easy to hard in the blink of an eye. For example, I really struggled with Sweetheart because she could make everybody angry in one turn while being happy/manic. Since I only had the ability to make everybody angry and not sad or happy, she easily had the upper hand.\n\nMost of the bosses were super fun to fight. Though not all of them had insanely deep mechanics, they made up for it in character. My favorite bosses being Sweetheart, Pluto (Expanded) and Omori.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nNext to the combat, Omori heavily focuses on exploration. You get to explore the cool fantasy world in Sunny’s mind, or the small Faraway Town in real life. I honestly don’t have much to say about the exploration. It was fun with all the easter eggs and items you could find. A lot of NPCs were fun to talk to. And exploring never got boring.\n\nThough I have to say, the most fun I had exploring was in places like Black Space or the Lost Library. I just love all the tiny bits of story scattered around these places and each one would make me want to explore even further.\n\n# 2. Graphics and Artstyle\n\n**Good Old Pixels**\n\nAbout half of the game’s artstyle is the pixelated one we see in the overworlds. It’s an artstyle that’s very prominent in indie games. Mostly because it’s cheaper and faster to create compared to more complex artstyles. Still, if used effectively, pixel artstyles can create awesome and memorable characters and scenes.\n\nAs a big fan of pixel art, walking through Omori’s worlds definitely scratched that itch of mine. Just the purple night sky alone looks amazing. On top of that come all the memorable areas like the green Vast Forest rich with nature, purple Otherworld filled with Sci-Fi, red and wealthy Sweetheart’s Castle etc. Each area inside Headspace has a well thought out design, making them incredibly memorable. That’s also why Faraway Town, the real world, almost feels like its out of place. It doesn’t have any special design behind it. It’s the real world, after all.\n\n**Pencils, simple but effective**\n\nThe other half of the game’s artstyle is the exceptional pencil artstyle we see in character portraits, photos, scenes etc. As a visual artist, I heavily love the pencil artstyle used in the game. It’s a mostly simple artstyle, like mine. For example, there’s only one color used for a character’s hair. You can see the clear direction of the strokes where each area was colored. And it’s not only the way of how it was colored. The choice of color and designs make this artstyle even better.\n\nI think the best example is the main character cast inside Headspace. Kel, Hero, Aubrey and Mari all have dark blue/purple hair. All of them have also have dark blue/purple eyes with a white center. Omori is entirely black and white with his eyes being completely black. There’s not a hint of actual color (hue) in Omori’s design while all his friends don’t have any traces of that “pure” black and white. And while the white centers of everybody’s eyes make them look happy and joyful, the complete black of Omori’s eyes make him look sad and depressed.\n\nBasil is also someone who stands out. In his character portrait, his design mostly consists of very bright and some darker blue tones while his eyes are white. In photos and scenes, his hair is turquoise instead. Of course these colors mirror his real life visuals. Yet, it makes him stand out compared to Mari and the others. These color choice were most likely made because Basil plays a much bigger part in Sunny’s mind than the others.\n\nThe one who sticks out the most, however, is Omori. None of the normal characters have the same “pure” black and white he has. There are only a few other images with that design. (I get deeper into this in subchapter “Colors with Meanings”).\n\nThe thing is, I detected these things so clearly because I’m a visual artist. Yet, most people aren’t. I’m sure that at this point you’ve realized how that doesn’t matter. Omori always grabs your eyes’ attention. He’s naturally noticeable in any frame his in. He will always stick out from his imaginary world. You most likely noticed it in every single combat you’ve entered. Even if you didn’t dissect the color design of every character like I did.\n\n**Animation**\n\nMost of the pencil art is animated. I’m not taking about stuff like character movement or expression changes. I’m specifically referring to the idle animations in this section. They consist of three frames (with a few exceptions) looping over the course of about a second. The frames themselves are actual redraws of the characters. They aren’t perfect since they need to be different enough for your eyes to be noticeable. I’ve noticed that even the paper background in the embrace scene between Sunny and Omori is a 3 frame animation.\n\nAgain, this is something that almost exclusively works with pencil art. An actual pencil has a bit of a “randomness” factor on how the lead gets onto the paper. The best way to describe it is looking at the hair of Omori (or any other character with dark hair color). You can see clear strokes due to the lead staying exactly where it touched the paper, unlike ink which is fluid and spreads. Your hand can’t perfectly fill out the space using a pencil without any gaps forming (at least not on the first try). All of these factors make pencil art more “random”. And it’s that randomness that’s makes the frames used in an animation look natural. It’s also why the frames don’t need to be perfectly traced. It simply adds to the character of the art/animation.\n\n**Colors with Meanings**\n\nOmori uses a lot of different colors to associate some symbolism/meaning behind them. The most prominent one is probably white and White Space. The game describes it as “An emptiness, a home without warmth. A place to survive, but not to live.” And indeed, white space consist of mostly nothing/white.\n\nAt the same time, it houses a black light bulb. Looking at it gives you some dialog saying that it’s pitch black inside. The black light bulb represents “the repression of an idea”. It’s supposed to keep all the thoughts regarding the trauma inside. The color black being the trauma Sunny holds. That becomes even more obvious once he destroys the black light bulb, symbolizing the beginning of him facing his trauma.\n\nOnly a few things in the game are designed with the “hue-less” black and white we see in White Space. And most of them are either 90% made of white or black. However, there is one thing that holds both of these colors. And that’s Omori. Like I mentioned in the section before, he’s designed with “pure” black and white. With his hair, eyes, shirt and socks being black, and his skin and shorts being white. Now, these color choices make even more sense. Omori is the embodiment of Sunny’s repression of the truth and the need for survival. Omori denies what happened and instead creates fictional worlds, both empty and full, to survive. There are only a couple other things that mix black and white. Most of them being directly related to Sunny’s trauma, like “Something” or the spirit of Mari.\n\nAnother prominent color symbolism is the emotion system. With anger being red, sadness being blue and happiness being yellow. Though it has its clear symbolism, the colors of the emotions is more of a gameplay aspect. The clear distinction between the colors makes it easier for the player too understand what a party member or an enemy is feeling. You don’t need to read the text to know what a character is feeling because of the facial expressions *and* the colors.\n\nStill, I have to say that some enemies’ emotions are harder to figure out than others. For example the Herald (Sprout Mole Guard) and Sir Maximus have a clear blue/red color design. When you encounter them for the first time, you’re a little unsure if they are sad/angry or if it’s simply their design. But these “issues” were only mildly present in my playthrough.\n\n# 3. Soundtrack\n\n**Banger after Banger**\n\nWhile I’m writing this review, I’m always listening to the Original Soundtrack from Omori. This game has so many incredible tracks. I haven’t even added all my personal favorites to my playlist due to there being ***179*** tracks. And so many of them are eargasm after eargasm. The boss themes go so hard and easily give you the epic and hectic feeling of fighting a difficult enemy. Some of my favorites being “World's End Valentine” (Sweetheart), “GOLDENVENGEANCE” (Pluto) and “Jawbreaker” (Mr. Jawsum). Even normal battle themes like “Three Bar Logos” (Otherworld fight) make me jam.\n\nThe tracks playing on the overworld are just as good as the battle themes. Themes like “Trees…” playing in the Vast Forest are slow and calming to fit the surroundings. Other tracks like “Stardust Diving” (Junkyard) or “Wandering Rose” (Sweetheart’s Castle) are a bit more extravagant, yet still fitting to the locations.\n\nThere are also a couple tracks used for moments where you hang out with your friends. Like “Let’s get together Now!” or “By Your Side”. I love these kinds of “character themes” because they make meeting up with such characters more unique. Whenever you hear one of these themes, you know you’re about to have a good time.\n\n**Horror Atmosphere**\n\nAn essential part to creating a horror atmosphere is having fitting soundtracks. Of course, you can always go with complete silence. Yet, to me, actual atmospheric music feels so much better. I’m not a composer, but I’ve heard enough horror tracks to know that there are a ton of ways to make us feel anxious.\n\nOmori makes excellent use of music during the horror segments. For example, each individual phobia segment has it’s own theme. Filled with creepy, otherworldly noises that enhance the horror experience. These track make the phobia segments that much better.\n\nThe one track that perfections this use of horror music, is “Omori” and “Omori – Alter”. The first track is played on the violin which is both the instrument Sunny plays and an instrument that’s frequently used for creating sad pieces. And then comes the Alter version. One that’s filled with weird sounds, distortions etc. What makes that track even better is how you can “hear” scenes from the fight between Mari and Sunny in it. Sounds like Mari screaming from falling backwards, Mari hitting the stairs, sentences like “No, no. Stop it!” or “Help me!”. This is true horror. These details enhance the experience of the Omori fight tenfold and are why I think horror music is much more impactful than complete silence.\n\n# 4. Story\n\n**Headspace and Escapism**\n\nMore than half of the game takes place in Sunny’s mind. In order to escape his trauma, he “created” the White Space. A space not made for living, but for surviving. It’s a tool for Sunny to repress the reality of what he did. Along with White Space came Omori. A younger version of Sunny from before the events of Mari’s death.\n\nSunny’s mind went even further and “created” the Headspace. A fictional place were he can hang out with his friends and his dead sister. Headspace visualizes a lot of things we come across in the real life segments of the game. Like Captain Spaceboy from the comics, Sweetheart from the sweets shop, or the tree stump from Mari’s grave.\n\nWhat’s so interesting to me about Headspace is that it’s a concept I’ve come across regularly in daily life. A good example of that is nostalgia. People feel a lot of nostalgia, especially for video games they grew up with. Why? Because it reminds them of a simpler time. A time where they didn’t have to live with the daily struggles of reality. A time where you could just be a kid and enjoy things. I’m pretty sure everybody deals with escapism to some degree. You don’t want to constantly be thinking about things that stress you out. You need a place where you can calm down and get away from daily life.\n\nSunny however takes it to another level. Since he doesn’t merely want to escape from stress. He wants to escape from the reality of what he did. Which is probably why his Headspace gets that deep. During my playthrough I’ve repeatedly found myself lost in Headspace, forgetting about the game’s real world every now and then. And still, even in Sunny’s attempt to run away, the reality of things manages to leak through the cracks.\n\n**Things you can’t take back**\n\nAs you get more into the game, you get told of what happened to Mari. First that she died. And secondly that it was a suicide. This hit me very hard. Losing someone close is already hard enough. Yet, knowing that it was a suicide makes it even worse. It’s painful to think about what Sunny went through. It was the answer I was seeking for when I wanted to know why he was traumatized. Why he closed himself off the way he did.\n\nBecause every time he thought about his sister, he deep down knew what happened. Sunny knew she was dead. And still, he chose to cling onto her in his Headspace. Grief is not only painful. It can do insane things to you. Depression can make your own mind consume itself. The same mind that is supposed to protect you from dying.\n\nI thought I knew what was going on. What Sunny was going through. But I could never have foreseen what actually happened. You know the scene I’m talking about. When you’re collecting “pictures” from the Truth Album. Realizing that Mari didn’t kill herself. How she died in a tragic accident. And that her “suicide” was a desperate attempt to run away from insufferable pain.\n\nThough the game itself only gives you the pictures, the game files contain the text matching the pictures. It’s probably the most we ever get of Sunny’s actual thoughts.\n\nIt wasn’t just some fight. Sunny was sick of playing the violin. To him, it wasn’t a rewarding hobby at all. It only made him more disconnected from his friends. And the sole reason for him to keep playing was getting to spend time with Mari. Yet, he had enough and broke it at the bottom of the stairs. Mari was, of course, mad at him. The notes don’t reveal what she says, merely that she’s yelling at Sunny and he doesn’t understand why. And when he tried to run away, she stood in his way. At that point, there was no rationality left in Sunny’s mind. He lost control and let it out on Mari by pushing her down the stairs.\n\nThis fight is so important due to it capturing a lot of doubt in Sunny’s mind. He thinks he’s not good enough. He thinks Mari cares more about the music than him. In the aftermath, he’s even doubting if it was an accident or not.\n\nIn the following pictures and texts, we see what this accident did to him. Sunny’s mind is loosing all control. He’s hoping that Mari wakes up. He’s hoping that he wakes up. He’s hoping that this isn’t reality. But it was. And it’s what slowly began to destroy his own mind.\n\nBasil, who saw the whole thing, couldn’t believe it either. Basil wouldn’t accept that it was Sunny who did this, because he thought Sunny was “good”. In a desperate attempt to cope with reality, Basil helped Sunny frame the death as a suicide. The notes mention that Sunny didn’t even acknowledge what was happening until after they hung up Mari on the tree. He didn’t even realize that is was Basil who was talking to him.\n\nKnowing all this is just… heartbreaking. It’s even worse than what I thought was going on. Dealing with a death of a close friend is one thing. But KNOWING that YOU did it is insanity. How could anybody, regardless of gender or age, cope with such fact? It doesn’t matter if it was an accident or not. Sunny will blame himself. Again and again he will hate himself for “killing” his sister.\n\nHonestly, I don’t blame him for what he did. Both the accident and the framing. This isn’t something you can go “he know what he was doing”. No. It’s pure loss of control. Loss over you mind. I’m convinced that no sane person could think “rationally” after such an incident. Even if Sunny were older. It doesn’t change what happened. Basil’s reaction is just the same. There was no thought or intent behind it. Only a lost mind acting on it’s own.\n\n**Accepting the Truth**\n\nFor the past 4 years, Sunny tried his best to deny what happened. To repress and forget what he did to Mari. Yet, no matter what he did. The truth would eventually get to him. Again and again. You can’t just forget such things. Even if you want to. Even if you *need* to. That’s why, after 4 years, the truth still finds its way back into Sunny’s mind.\n\nThe fight against Omori is the perfect embodiment of Sunny’s depression and how to deal with it. During the fight, Sunny tries to kill Omori, again and again. All the while Omori is facing him with all the traumatizing thoughts he ever had.\n\n“Your friends will never forgive you.”\n“People like you don't deserve to live.”\n“You're nothing but a liar... and when they see the truth…”\n“They'll hate you as much as you hate yourself.”\n“You killed MARI. She loved you and you killed her.”\n“You should just die.”\n\nThe sad thing about these quotes is that they’re so relatable. These are the exact thoughts a person like Sunny would feel. These are the exact thoughts that will not only start, but drown you in depression. Even when remembering his friends. How they told Sunny to not give up and to keep going, he can’t win. Omori does and will persist. Because you can’t kill something that’s an essential part of yourself. You can’t simply kill your depression.\n\nUpon the scripted defeat, you can choose to give up and let Omori win, or persist and let Sunny overcome. Letting Omori win is giving in to the “obvious” choice of suicide. Sunny jumps of the balcony in the hospital and permanently ends his pain, and his life.\n\nYet, if you persist, Sunny will take up his Violin and starts to play. The memorable cutscene of the duet is exactly what needed to happen. Sunny needed to give in to reality. To the fact that he did kill his beloved sister. He lets his memories of her flood back into his minds and starts to overcome. He accepts what he did. That’s what the hug with Omori shows. Sunny didn’t kill Omori. He embraces him instead, accepting reality, and moves forward.\n\nSunny wakes up in the hospital. For the first time in the entire game, we see him genuinely express emotions other than fear. Sure, Sunny can get angry or sad during the real world fights. However this is the first time he expresses emotions without any outside influence. He cries, knowing what he did, and gets up. He runs to Basil and his friends, and tells them the truth. In the secret ending, we see the “Something” behind Sunny (and Basil) disappear, with him smiling while he sheds a tear. That scene is so important since it proves that he accepted what he did, and moved on. The credits prove this even further. Sunny didn’t forget what happened. He *accepted* it as part of himself.\n\n“Sometimes I think\nMaybe its too late\nThough the pain remain\nsAnd though it may be hard\nI'll carry on”\n\nWe don’t know how Kel, Aubrey and Hero reacted. All we get to see that Sunny tells them the truth, how he and Basil are smiling at each other, and how Sunny looks out the window of his moms car. We know that his friends didn’t attack him. Yet, we don’t know if they forgave Sunny and Basil either. Honestly, I think it’s for the best that we don’t. Authentically showing how they reacted would have been nearly impossible. And even if we did get to see their reactions, it would have felt unsatisfying. The problem is that dealing with such a hard truth takes more than the few hours they have before Sunny moves away. I don’t think any of them would have been able to immediately forgive Sunny and Basil. It would have taken months or years for the three to fully digest the truth, just like it did for Sunny.\n\nThough the open ending was made for use to interpret and theories how Kel, Aubrey and Hero reacted, nobody will ever fully know. And honestly, it is quite hard to know how they reacted. Because the truth is such an insanely difficult thing to digest. Since I love these types of mysteries that are open to interpretation, I won’t go into any further detail about the groups reactions.\n\nI’m happy for Sunny. I’m glad that finally learned how to live with his past. It takes immense strength to overcome such a struggle. And after 4 years, he did it. Sunny can finally go and enjoy life again. Of course, he won’t forget his past. But he also won’t let it control him anymore. The same goes for Basil, of course. I’m truly happy for the both of them.\n\n**What is Omori**\n\nIt’s not exactly clear what Omori, the character, exactly is. Most people speculate that Omori is either *simply* the embodiment of Sunny’s repression and denial, or that he’s a separate identity altogether (a result of Dissociative Identity Disorder). The first time I wrote this section, I debated that there isn’t a clear answer. I mean, we don’t have any confirmation as far as I know.\n\nThe more I thought about it, however, the more I tend to the side that Omori is not a separate identity. It wouldn’t make sense to me that, while Omori explores Headspace, Sunny would continue to live in White Space. Headspace is Sunny’s way of running from the truth. And his real life experiences, like overcoming a phobia, has an IMMEDIATE impact on Omori in Headspace. Furthermore, it wouldn’t make sense to me that Omori would “commit suicide” just to respawn again the next time you visit White Space. And lastly, why would Omori throw all these truths at Sunny during the boss fight? Omori is the embodiment of Sunny’s denial and repression. So why would he decide to suddenly become the opposite? Because Sunny is trying to kill Omori?\n\nThough everything could be answered with DID, I didn’t feel to me like that was the case. Omori is made out of Sunny’s repression, depression, denial, fear and escapism. He is how Sunny runs away from the truth. By creating fictional worlds in the past, were all his friends are still with him and everything is “okay”. Having little adventures in whatever Sunny’s mind can come up with. The fight against Omori felt like Sunny facing his depression and trauma rather than an actual identity. The final embrace and Omori vanishing gave me the feeling of Sunny accepting the truth, not him merging with a separate identity (which is possible from what I’ve read). The fact that Omori couldn’t die felt like it was because Sunny can’t simply kill part of himself (though you apparently can’t kill a separate identity either).\n\nYet, I’m only speculating here. There are answers everywhere to both theories. I’m not a psychologist. And even if I was, I don’t think it would be much clearer to me. DID is still a huge mystery to us, just like the brain itself. And we haven’t gotten any clear answers. From my perspective, Omori is simply the embodiment of Sunny’s repression and trauma, not a separate identity.\n\n**Mari**\n\nAn interesting fact I picked up from another user is that we, the player, never get to really know Mari. All we get to see from her actual self are the photos and the memories. The Mari we see in Headspace is but Sunny’s image of her. One that only shows her positives.\n\nHowever, we know that Mari had her negatives. She’s a perfectionist. And she lashed out on Sunny. That’s… all we know. And it makes sense. Sunny would try his best to remember her positives since remembering Mari’s negatives would bring him closer to the truth.\n\nI think it’s important to note that we don’t see a lot of Mari’s negatives. That doesn’t mean that Sunny didn’t love her or that Mari was a bad person. It means that most likely there were more of these “fights” between Mari and Sunny than we know of. Mari wasn’t perfect and fights breaking out between people, especially children and teenagers, are a common thing.\n\n# 5. Personal Thoughts & Opinions\n\n**Important Note**\n\nI’m not a psychiatrist or psychologist. The following chapters are ***not*** meant be seen as professional advice. They are simply my thoughts and experiences. How I experienced certain traumas and how I overcame them. What helped me and what not.\n\nIf you’re suffering from depression, please know that I’m not trying to disrespect or insult you in any kind of way in these chapters. Again, I’m just describing what and how I experienced things.\n\n**Losing Yourself**\n\nLosing control over yourself is one of the scariest things to me. I remember one specific time were I completely lost it. Though I was lucky enough that nothing bad happened. I was about 10 years old, walking home from school with my friends. We were looking at our baby photos, since we had to take some to school for making a birthday calendar. One of my friends accidentally got a small dent into my photo (the original, not a copy). I didn’t know how to react. But I knew that this dent would forever be there and that the photo could never be retaken again. I got so furious that I lashed out at him, pulling his hair as I lost myself. Luckily, my other friend pulled us apart and nobody got seriously injured.\n\nOf course, I would never forget this memory. I never attacked anyone before, majorly due to me being very weak as a child and knowing I didn’t stand a chance. And still, I knew I did that. I hurt a friend that I loved. The scary thing isn’t only that it happened. It’s knowing that it could happen again. That if I’m enraged enough, I can hurt the people I love. And just imagine how I would feel if there would have been some kind of permanent damage. This memory is the main reason I’m a pacifist today and try to avoid any kind of violence. Even stuff like hitting your desk in anger. Because I don’t ever want to loose control again.\n\nThis memory is also the reason why I understand why Sunny and Basil did what they did. They did it because they lost complete control over themselves. The Photo of Sunny pushing Mari reads “You lose all sense and push her down the staircase.” He lost it since it was too much for him to handle. The anger from playing an instrument that only caused him pain, coupled with Mari yelling at him and not understanding him. The weight of it all made him lose it and react irrationally. And after Sunny realized what he did, it got even worse. Having to deal with grief when you’re already at a weak point is too much to handle.\n\nI’m not trying to say it was okay what Sunny and Basil did. I’m saying that I understand ***why*** they did it. That there wasn’t any evil intent there. Just lost minds acting on their own.\n\n**Forgiving Sunny and Basil**\n\nWould I forgive Sunny and Basil for what they did? I think I would. I know it was an accident. The framing was a desperate act. I know how much pain they would cause themselves for what happened. And after 4 years of “living” with that pain, releasing Sunny and Basil from their torment is more than overdue.\n\nYet the problem is that this comes from an outside perspective. I wasn’t there spending time with Mari and the others. I wasn’t there when she supposedly committed suicide. I wasn’t Kel, Aubrey or Hero. I wasn’t Mari’s friend.\n\nIf you asked me if I would forgive someone for accidentally killing a close friend of mine and framing it as a suicide, I think I probably couldn’t forgive them. Even if I knew that it was an accident, that it happened years ago, that the framing was an act of sheer desperation and that I should forgive them, I don’t know if I could.\n\nI know that my grief would become even stronger than when I thought it was a suicide. I wouldn’t know what to think. I generally believe that forgiveness is very important, especially when there was no ill intent. But still, I don’t how I would react. Because every time I see that person, it’s a reminder that they were the one who killed my friend, even if it was an accident. Ultimately, I can’t answer if I could forgive somebody like Sunny or Basil. I can’t possibly know.\n\n**Acceptance and overcoming Depression**\n\nDepression has many causes. Most people who have depression didn’t kill a family member, obviously. Yet, a lot of depressions come from things that you do/did. From self-doubt. From lack of self-confidence. And of course from traumatic experiences. Sunny’s depression mostly came not only from the traumatic experience of losing his sister, but knowing that he was the cause of it.\n\nI myself faced depression as well. It was after I played Doki Doki Literature Club. One of the characters in the game, your childhood friend, commits suicide. It was traumatizing to me. Even though I’ve seen playthroughs of the game before, playing it myself was so different. It didn’t just make me aware of what depression is. It made me aware that people all around the world are suffering from it. It can be anybody. Even someone you know could be suffering from depression. Even somebody who seems happy on the outside.\n\nI was devastated. What kind of world is this to live in? A world full of pain and suffering? A lot of which is caused by our own kind? It was miserable to think about. I felt so weak since I couldn’t do anything about it. It got so bad that I desperately tried helping friends who had depression. Even if I could make them smile or laugh a little, I thought it would help me cope.\n\nObviously, it never did. The same thoughts would always come back to me. No matter what I did. Yet, after tons of suffering and painful experiences, I found my way out. By **accepting** the truth. By **accepting** that this is reality. **Accepting**, that the world is full of suffering. **Accepting**, that I’m just a human who can’t solve everything. It was that **acceptance**, that allowed me to move on.\n\nIt doesn’t mean that I should not care. I care much about the people I love. I still make an effort to make people laugh and smile. Not because it helps me cope, but because it makes me glad. I can never fully know how somebody’s feeling on a particular day. Which is why I like to make them smile. Even if its only a little, knowing that I can sweeten somebody’s day by a tiny bit makes me incredibly happy.\n\nAt the same time, I learned how to not care about things out of my reach. There simply are things I can’t do anything about. I can’t help everybody on the planet. I can’t cure depression or other severe illnesses. **But that’s okay**. It’s okay that I can’t solve everything. I am just a human, not some kind of god. This realization is another part that incredibly helped me. It helps me separate myself from problems where I am powerless. It helps me **accept** that I can’t change certain things.\n\nI’m well aware that acceptance isn’t always the cure and that it can feel unobtainable. That there are a ton of other things that can worsen your mental health. I’m going through something else right now that I haven’t been able to accept for most of my life. However, I would be lying if I said that acceptance hasn’t helped me a ton with my struggles.\n\n**The Beauty in Sadness**\n\nSadness is a common emotion of the brain. Sadness comes from various sources. The source that hits me the most is empathy. I’m an incredibly empathetic person. It helps me understand others better. At the same time, it’s also a weakness. Sad scenes in media can easily affect me. To help us cope with sadness, our brains make us cry. It releases stress and anxiety and helps us calm down.\n\nThough sadness is often a miserable thing, I learned that there is a certain beauty behind it. The show “Violet Evergarden” taught me that. In case you haven’t seen it, the show resolves around Violet, a young girl who grew up as an emotionless child. During the show, she doesn’t only learn what emotions are, but also what empathy is. And how important it is. A lot of the episodes are incredibly sad as they often include topics like loosing a loved one. Watching Violet Evergarden makes me cry, again and again. Yet, the sadness is not the reason why I’m watching it. It’s the beauty behind it.\n\nWhy is loosing a loved one sad? Because of the love itself. It wouldn’t be sad if the two people didn’t love each other. No matter if it was platonically or romantically. It’s the love the people shared for each other that makes it sad. That’s what makes it beautiful. Crying about loosing a loved one is a *testament* about how much you cared about that person. How much that person meant to you and how much you loved them.\n\nOf course, it’s still sad. But also beautiful. And that’s why I like these stories so much. I cried so hard when watching the final duet in Omori because I knew how much Sunny and Mari loved each other. I knew how incredibly painful it was for Sunny. Watching him and Mari grow up together with their smiles on their faces. It’s both heartwarming and dreadful. I haven’t cried that hard since watching Violet Evergarden. The combination of sadness and beauty is an indescribable feeling. One that I love to feel from time to time.\n\nI myself haven’t experienced loosing a loved one so far. And I’m afraid of the day it will happen. However, I’m sure that experiences like Omori will make it easier for me, even if just for a little.\n\n# 6. Conclusion\n\n**True Horror**\n\nI’m actually not a big fan of horror games. The main reason is because a ton of them use the same concepts. You run around in a pitch black area with a flashlight, getting chased by a monster that one shots you with a jumpscare. And you can’t do anything against it except hiding or stunning it. This concept is just boring to me. Aimlessly running around isn’t fun. And sure, jumpscares can be scary when you don’t expect them. Yet, it only scares me for a second and then everything is normal again.\n\nPsychological horror however, that’s interesting to me. I love the feeling of my own mind trying to piece things together. To be terrified by the horror and sad by the drama, at the same time. I want the horror to leave an impact on me. One that still holds after getting scared. One that leaves an imprint on my mind outside the game!\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club and Omori are the only games I’ve played so far that gave me those feelings. Horror is so much more impactful when you’re sad at the same time. Mourning the death of Mari while facing the horror of the Omori bossfight, it’s an indescribable feeling. Of course, I have to watch out that I don’t fall into depression.\n\nI first came across Omori randomly on YouTube. The algorithm showed me the newly released “Omori Preorder Promo” for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch releases. Though that trailer was very short, it was enough for me to know what I would get myself into. I added it to my favorites playlist, where I usually exclusively add short song pieces, and moved on. I knew I would eventually find it again in my playlist and I did so two weeks ago. I bought it and played through it in just 4 days. After finishing it, I was sad, but in the way I wanted. It’s the beauty and sadness combined what I love. That’s why I wanted to play Omori. ***That’s the Experience I seek!***\n\n**An Unforgettable Experience**\n\nThe game Omori does so many things right. It throws you into an intriguing story, walking around astounding places, fighting interesting bosses with your friends. Everything feels so well thought out. The music is always fitting, the character designs have a lot of thought behind them, the story makes you yearn for more answers etc.\n\nThough I haven’t come across Omori before seeing the promo trailer, I can tell by playing the game that it needed the long development time it did. Because you can’t give everything this much detail in one or two years. I’m incredibly glad that Omocat and the Team were able to finish this project. It’s an incredible game, an incredible **experience**, that I’ll never forget.\n\n**Thank you so much, Omocat and the Omori Team, for creating Omori!**\n\n**And thank you, dear reader, for reading my in depth review!**",

It's meant for people who finished at least the Sunny/True Route. I will write a separate post about the Omori/Neutral Route once I’ve played through it. If you haven't finished the game yet, please refrain from reading this review since it will ruin your experience.**\n\n**It goes without saying that this review gets pretty dark. If you’re still mentally recovering from playing Omori, I advice you to not read this review until you’re in a better place.**\n\nAlso, I have to clear something up first. I don’t wanna give this game any rating based on some random scale. Numbers can’t even remotely describe how much I like or dislike something. I believe a critique/rating can’t be summed up by numbers. Nonetheless, I hope you’ll enjoy this review!\n\n# Index:\n\n1. Gameplay\n2. Graphics and Artstyle\n3. Soundtrack\n4. Story\n5. Personal Thoughts & Opinions\n6. Conclusion\n\n# 1. Gameplay\n\n**Combat**\n\nI’m usually not a big fan of turn based RPGs. I need some level of interactivity or strategy for turn based combat to be interesting to me. Interactivity like timing your attacks by hitting a button. Or strategy like Omori’s emotion system. For me, it needs to be more than merely damage, heal, exploit weaknesses etc.\n\nI actually liked the combat of Omori very much. The emotion system isn’t just interesting by creating weaknesses and strengths. Each emotion comes with several effects like a higher chance of critical hits but also a higher chance of missing. And the fact that ANY character can feel ANY emotion makes this so much better. A fight can turn from easy to hard in the blink of an eye. For example, I really struggled with Sweetheart because she could make everybody angry in one turn while being happy/manic. Since I only had the ability to make everybody angry and not sad or happy, she easily had the upper hand.\n\nMost of the bosses were super fun to fight. Though not all of them had insanely deep mechanics, they made up for it in character. My favorite bosses being Sweetheart, Pluto  Expanded  and Omori.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nNext to the combat, Omori heavily focuses on exploration. You get to explore the cool fantasy world in Sunny’s mind, or the small Faraway Town in real life. I honestly don’t have much to say about the exploration. It was fun with all the easter eggs and items you could find. A lot of NPCs were fun to talk to. And exploring never got boring.\n\nThough I have to say, the most fun I had exploring was in places like Black Space or the Lost Library. I just love all the tiny bits of story scattered around these places and each one would make me want to explore even further.\n\n# 2. Graphics and Artstyle\n\n**Good Old Pixels**\n\nAbout half of the game’s artstyle is the pixelated one we see in the overworlds. It’s an artstyle that’s very prominent in indie games. Mostly because it’s cheaper and faster to create compared to more complex artstyles. Still, if used effectively, pixel artstyles can create awesome and memorable characters and scenes.\n\nAs a big fan of pixel art, walking through Omori’s worlds definitely scratched that itch of mine. Just the purple night sky alone looks amazing. On top of that come all the memorable areas like the green Vast Forest rich with nature, purple Otherworld filled with Sci-Fi, red and wealthy Sweetheart’s Castle etc. Each area inside Headspace has a well thought out design, making them incredibly memorable. That’s also why Faraway Town, the real world, almost feels like its out of place. It doesn’t have any special design behind it. It’s the real world, after all.\n\n**Pencils, simple but effective**\n\nThe other half of the game’s artstyle is the exceptional pencil artstyle we see in character portraits, photos, scenes etc. As a visual artist, I heavily love the pencil artstyle used in the game. It’s a mostly simple artstyle, like mine. For example, there’s only one color used for a character’s hair. You can see the clear direction of the strokes where each area was colored. And it’s not only the way of how it was colored. The choice of color and designs make this artstyle even better.\n\nI think the best example is the main character cast inside Headspace. Kel, Hero, Aubrey and Mari all have dark blue/purple hair. All of them have also have dark blue/purple eyes with a white center. Omori is entirely black and white with his eyes being completely black. There’s not a hint of actual color  hue  in Omori’s design while all his friends don’t have any traces of that “pure” black and white. And while the white centers of everybody’s eyes make them look happy and joyful, the complete black of Omori’s eyes make him look sad and depressed.\n\nBasil is also someone who stands out. In his character portrait, his design mostly consists of very bright and some darker blue tones while his eyes are white. In photos and scenes, his hair is turquoise instead. Of course these colors mirror his real life visuals. Yet, it makes him stand out compared to Mari and the others. These color choice were most likely made because Basil plays a much bigger part in Sunny’s mind than the others.\n\nThe one who sticks out the most, however, is Omori. None of the normal characters have the same “pure” black and white he has. There are only a few other images with that design.  I get deeper into this in subchapter “Colors with Meanings” .\n\nThe thing is, I detected these things so clearly because I’m a visual artist. Yet, most people aren’t. I’m sure that at this point you’ve realized how that doesn’t matter. Omori always grabs your eyes’ attention. He’s naturally noticeable in any frame his in. He will always stick out from his imaginary world. You most likely noticed it in every single combat you’ve entered. Even if you didn’t dissect the color design of every character like I did.\n\n**Animation**\n\nMost of the pencil art is animated. I’m not taking about stuff like character movement or expression changes. I’m specifically referring to the idle animations in this section. They consist of three frames  with a few exceptions  looping over the course of about a second. The frames themselves are actual redraws of the characters. They aren’t perfect since they need to be different enough for your eyes to be noticeable. I’ve noticed that even the paper background in the embrace scene between Sunny and Omori is a 3 frame animation.\n\nAgain, this is something that almost exclusively works with pencil art. An actual pencil has a bit of a “randomness” factor on how the lead gets onto the paper. The best way to describe it is looking at the hair of Omori  or any other character with dark hair color . You can see clear strokes due to the lead staying exactly where it touched the paper, unlike ink which is fluid and spreads. Your hand can’t perfectly fill out the space using a pencil without any gaps forming  at least not on the first try . All of these factors make pencil art more “random”. And it’s that randomness that’s makes the frames used in an animation look natural. It’s also why the frames don’t need to be perfectly traced. It simply adds to the character of the art/animation.\n\n**Colors with Meanings**\n\nOmori uses a lot of different colors to associate some symbolism/meaning behind them. The most prominent one is probably white and White Space. The game describes it as “An emptiness, a home without warmth. A place to survive, but not to live.” And indeed, white space consist of mostly nothing/white.\n\nAt the same time, it houses a black light bulb. Looking at it gives you some dialog saying that it’s pitch black inside. The black light bulb represents “the repression of an idea”. It’s supposed to keep all the thoughts regarding the trauma inside. The color black being the trauma Sunny holds. That becomes even more obvious once he destroys the black light bulb, symbolizing the beginning of him facing his trauma.\n\nOnly a few things in the game are designed with the “hue-less” black and white we see in White Space. And most of them are either 90% made of white or black. However, there is one thing that holds both of these colors. And that’s Omori. Like I mentioned in the section before, he’s designed with “pure” black and white. With his hair, eyes, shirt and socks being black, and his skin and shorts being white. Now, these color choices make even more sense. Omori is the embodiment of Sunny’s repression of the truth and the need for survival. Omori denies what happened and instead creates fictional worlds, both empty and full, to survive. There are only a couple other things that mix black and white. Most of them being directly related to Sunny’s trauma, like “Something” or the spirit of Mari.\n\nAnother prominent color symbolism is the emotion system. With anger being red, sadness being blue and happiness being yellow. Though it has its clear symbolism, the colors of the emotions is more of a gameplay aspect. The clear distinction between the colors makes it easier for the player too understand what a party member or an enemy is feeling. You don’t need to read the text to know what a character is feeling because of the facial expressions *and* the colors.\n\nStill, I have to say that some enemies’ emotions are harder to figure out than others. For example the Herald  Sprout Mole Guard  and Sir Maximus have a clear blue/red color design. When you encounter them for the first time, you’re a little unsure if they are sad/angry or if it’s simply their design. But these “issues” were only mildly present in my playthrough.\n\n# 3. Soundtrack\n\n**Banger after Banger**\n\nWhile I’m writing this review, I’m always listening to the Original Soundtrack from Omori. This game has so many incredible tracks. I haven’t even added all my personal favorites to my playlist due to there being ***179*** tracks. And so many of them are eargasm after eargasm. The boss themes go so hard and easily give you the epic and hectic feeling of fighting a difficult enemy. Some of my favorites being “World's End Valentine”  Sweetheart , “GOLDENVENGEANCE”  Pluto  and “Jawbreaker”  Mr. Jawsum . Even normal battle themes like “Three Bar Logos”  Otherworld fight  make me jam.\n\nThe tracks playing on the overworld are just as good as the battle themes. Themes like “Trees…” playing in the Vast Forest are slow and calming to fit the surroundings. Other tracks like “Stardust Diving”  Junkyard  or “Wandering Rose”  Sweetheart’s Castle  are a bit more extravagant, yet still fitting to the locations.\n\nThere are also a couple tracks used for moments where you hang out with your friends. Like “Let’s get together Now!” or “By Your Side”. I love these kinds of “character themes” because they make meeting up with such characters more unique. Whenever you hear one of these themes, you know you’re about to have a good time.\n\n**Horror Atmosphere**\n\nAn essential part to creating a horror atmosphere is having fitting soundtracks. Of course, you can always go with complete silence. Yet, to me, actual atmospheric music feels so much better. I’m not a composer, but I’ve heard enough horror tracks to know that there are a ton of ways to make us feel anxious.\n\nOmori makes excellent use of music during the horror segments. For example, each individual phobia segment has it’s own theme. Filled with creepy, otherworldly noises that enhance the horror experience. These track make the phobia segments that much better.\n\nThe one track that perfections this use of horror music, is “Omori” and “Omori – Alter”. The first track is played on the violin which is both the instrument Sunny plays and an instrument that’s frequently used for creating sad pieces. And then comes the Alter version. One that’s filled with weird sounds, distortions etc. What makes that track even better is how you can “hear” scenes from the fight between Mari and Sunny in it. Sounds like Mari screaming from falling backwards, Mari hitting the stairs, sentences like “No, no. Stop it!” or “Help me!”. This is true horror. These details enhance the experience of the Omori fight tenfold and are why I think horror music is much more impactful than complete silence.\n\n# 4. Story\n\n**Headspace and Escapism**\n\nMore than half of the game takes place in Sunny’s mind. In order to escape his trauma, he “created” the White Space. A space not made for living, but for surviving. It’s a tool for Sunny to repress the reality of what he did. Along with White Space came Omori. A younger version of Sunny from before the events of Mari’s death.\n\nSunny’s mind went even further and “created” the Headspace. A fictional place were he can hang out with his friends and his dead sister. Headspace visualizes a lot of things we come across in the real life segments of the game. Like Captain Spaceboy from the comics, Sweetheart from the sweets shop, or the tree stump from Mari’s grave.\n\nWhat’s so interesting to me about Headspace is that it’s a concept I’ve come across regularly in daily life. A good example of that is nostalgia. People feel a lot of nostalgia, especially for video games they grew up with. Why? Because it reminds them of a simpler time. A time where they didn’t have to live with the daily struggles of reality. A time where you could just be a kid and enjoy things. I’m pretty sure everybody deals with escapism to some degree. You don’t want to constantly be thinking about things that stress you out. You need a place where you can calm down and get away from daily life.\n\nSunny however takes it to another level. Since he doesn’t merely want to escape from stress. He wants to escape from the reality of what he did. Which is probably why his Headspace gets that deep. During my playthrough I’ve repeatedly found myself lost in Headspace, forgetting about the game’s real world every now and then. And still, even in Sunny’s attempt to run away, the reality of things manages to leak through the cracks.\n\n**Things you can’t take back**\n\nAs you get more into the game, you get told of what happened to Mari. First that she died. And secondly that it was a suicide. This hit me very hard. Losing someone close is already hard enough. Yet, knowing that it was a suicide makes it even worse. It’s painful to think about what Sunny went through. It was the answer I was seeking for when I wanted to know why he was traumatized. Why he closed himself off the way he did.\n\nBecause every time he thought about his sister, he deep down knew what happened. Sunny knew she was dead. And still, he chose to cling onto her in his Headspace. Grief is not only painful. It can do insane things to you. Depression can make your own mind consume itself. The same mind that is supposed to protect you from dying.\n\nI thought I knew what was going on. What Sunny was going through. But I could never have foreseen what actually happened. You know the scene I’m talking about. When you’re collecting “pictures” from the Truth Album. Realizing that Mari didn’t kill herself. How she died in a tragic accident. And that her “suicide” was a desperate attempt to run away from insufferable pain.\n\nThough the game itself only gives you the pictures, the game files contain the text matching the pictures. It’s probably the most we ever get of Sunny’s actual thoughts.\n\nIt wasn’t just some fight. Sunny was sick of playing the violin. To him, it wasn’t a rewarding hobby at all. It only made him more disconnected from his friends. And the sole reason for him to keep playing was getting to spend time with Mari. Yet, he had enough and broke it at the bottom of the stairs. Mari was, of course, mad at him. The notes don’t reveal what she says, merely that she’s yelling at Sunny and he doesn’t understand why. And when he tried to run away, she stood in his way. At that point, there was no rationality left in Sunny’s mind. He lost control and let it out on Mari by pushing her down the stairs.\n\nThis fight is so important due to it capturing a lot of doubt in Sunny’s mind. He thinks he’s not good enough. He thinks Mari cares more about the music than him. In the aftermath, he’s even doubting if it was an accident or not.\n\nIn the following pictures and texts, we see what this accident did to him. Sunny’s mind is loosing all control. He’s hoping that Mari wakes up. He’s hoping that he wakes up. He’s hoping that this isn’t reality. But it was. And it’s what slowly began to destroy his own mind.\n\nBasil, who saw the whole thing, couldn’t believe it either. Basil wouldn’t accept that it was Sunny who did this, because he thought Sunny was “good”. In a desperate attempt to cope with reality, Basil helped Sunny frame the death as a suicide. The notes mention that Sunny didn’t even acknowledge what was happening until after they hung up Mari on the tree. He didn’t even realize that is was Basil who was talking to him.\n\nKnowing all this is just… heartbreaking. It’s even worse than what I thought was going on. Dealing with a death of a close friend is one thing. But KNOWING that YOU did it is insanity. How could anybody, regardless of gender or age, cope with such fact? It doesn’t matter if it was an accident or not. Sunny will blame himself. Again and again he will hate himself for “killing” his sister.\n\nHonestly, I don’t blame him for what he did. Both the accident and the framing. This isn’t something you can go “he know what he was doing”. No. It’s pure loss of control. Loss over you mind. I’m convinced that no sane person could think “rationally” after such an incident. Even if Sunny were older. It doesn’t change what happened. Basil’s reaction is just the same. There was no thought or intent behind it. Only a lost mind acting on it’s own.\n\n**Accepting the Truth**\n\nFor the past 4 years, Sunny tried his best to deny what happened. To repress and forget what he did to Mari. Yet, no matter what he did. The truth would eventually get to him. Again and again. You can’t just forget such things. Even if you want to. Even if you *need* to. That’s why, after 4 years, the truth still finds its way back into Sunny’s mind.\n\nThe fight against Omori is the perfect embodiment of Sunny’s depression and how to deal with it. During the fight, Sunny tries to kill Omori, again and again. All the while Omori is facing him with all the traumatizing thoughts he ever had.\n\n“Your friends will never forgive you.”\n“People like you don't deserve to live.”\n“You're nothing but a liar... and when they see the truth…”\n“They'll hate you as much as you hate yourself.”\n“You killed MARI. She loved you and you killed her.”\n“You should just die.”\n\nThe sad thing about these quotes is that they’re so relatable. These are the exact thoughts a person like Sunny would feel. These are the exact thoughts that will not only start, but drown you in depression. Even when remembering his friends. How they told Sunny to not give up and to keep going, he can’t win. Omori does and will persist. Because you can’t kill something that’s an essential part of yourself. You can’t simply kill your depression.\n\nUpon the scripted defeat, you can choose to give up and let Omori win, or persist and let Sunny overcome. Letting Omori win is giving in to the “obvious” choice of suicide. Sunny jumps of the balcony in the hospital and permanently ends his pain, and his life.\n\nYet, if you persist, Sunny will take up his Violin and starts to play. The memorable cutscene of the duet is exactly what needed to happen. Sunny needed to give in to reality. To the fact that he did kill his beloved sister. He lets his memories of her flood back into his minds and starts to overcome. He accepts what he did. That’s what the hug with Omori shows. Sunny didn’t kill Omori. He embraces him instead, accepting reality, and moves forward.\n\nSunny wakes up in the hospital. For the first time in the entire game, we see him genuinely express emotions other than fear. Sure, Sunny can get angry or sad during the real world fights. However this is the first time he expresses emotions without any outside influence. He cries, knowing what he did, and gets up. He runs to Basil and his friends, and tells them the truth. In the secret ending, we see the “Something” behind Sunny  and Basil  disappear, with him smiling while he sheds a tear. That scene is so important since it proves that he accepted what he did, and moved on. The credits prove this even further. Sunny didn’t forget what happened. He *accepted* it as part of himself.\n\n“Sometimes I think\nMaybe its too late\nThough the pain remain\nsAnd though it may be hard\nI'll carry on”\n\nWe don’t know how Kel, Aubrey and Hero reacted. All we get to see that Sunny tells them the truth, how he and Basil are smiling at each other, and how Sunny looks out the window of his moms car. We know that his friends didn’t attack him. Yet, we don’t know if they forgave Sunny and Basil either. Honestly, I think it’s for the best that we don’t. Authentically showing how they reacted would have been nearly impossible. And even if we did get to see their reactions, it would have felt unsatisfying. The problem is that dealing with such a hard truth takes more than the few hours they have before Sunny moves away. I don’t think any of them would have been able to immediately forgive Sunny and Basil. It would have taken months or years for the three to fully digest the truth, just like it did for Sunny.\n\nThough the open ending was made for use to interpret and theories how Kel, Aubrey and Hero reacted, nobody will ever fully know. And honestly, it is quite hard to know how they reacted. Because the truth is such an insanely difficult thing to digest. Since I love these types of mysteries that are open to interpretation, I won’t go into any further detail about the groups reactions.\n\nI’m happy for Sunny. I’m glad that finally learned how to live with his past. It takes immense strength to overcome such a struggle. And after 4 years, he did it. Sunny can finally go and enjoy life again. Of course, he won’t forget his past. But he also won’t let it control him anymore. The same goes for Basil, of course. I’m truly happy for the both of them.\n\n**What is Omori**\n\nIt’s not exactly clear what Omori, the character, exactly is. Most people speculate that Omori is either *simply* the embodiment of Sunny’s repression and denial, or that he’s a separate identity altogether  a result of Dissociative Identity Disorder . The first time I wrote this section, I debated that there isn’t a clear answer. I mean, we don’t have any confirmation as far as I know.\n\nThe more I thought about it, however, the more I tend to the side that Omori is not a separate identity. It wouldn’t make sense to me that, while Omori explores Headspace, Sunny would continue to live in White Space. Headspace is Sunny’s way of running from the truth. And his real life experiences, like overcoming a phobia, has an IMMEDIATE impact on Omori in Headspace. Furthermore, it wouldn’t make sense to me that Omori would “commit suicide” just to respawn again the next time you visit White Space. And lastly, why would Omori throw all these truths at Sunny during the boss fight? Omori is the embodiment of Sunny’s denial and repression. So why would he decide to suddenly become the opposite? Because Sunny is trying to kill Omori?\n\nThough everything could be answered with DID, I didn’t feel to me like that was the case. Omori is made out of Sunny’s repression, depression, denial, fear and escapism. He is how Sunny runs away from the truth. By creating fictional worlds in the past, were all his friends are still with him and everything is “okay”. Having little adventures in whatever Sunny’s mind can come up with. The fight against Omori felt like Sunny facing his depression and trauma rather than an actual identity. The final embrace and Omori vanishing gave me the feeling of Sunny accepting the truth, not him merging with a separate identity  which is possible from what I’ve read . The fact that Omori couldn’t die felt like it was because Sunny can’t simply kill part of himself  though you apparently can’t kill a separate identity either .\n\nYet, I’m only speculating here. There are answers everywhere to both theories. I’m not a psychologist. And even if I was, I don’t think it would be much clearer to me. DID is still a huge mystery to us, just like the brain itself. And we haven’t gotten any clear answers. From my perspective, Omori is simply the embodiment of Sunny’s repression and trauma, not a separate identity.\n\n**Mari**\n\nAn interesting fact I picked up from another user is that we, the player, never get to really know Mari. All we get to see from her actual self are the photos and the memories. The Mari we see in Headspace is but Sunny’s image of her. One that only shows her positives.\n\nHowever, we know that Mari had her negatives. She’s a perfectionist. And she lashed out on Sunny. That’s… all we know. And it makes sense. Sunny would try his best to remember her positives since remembering Mari’s negatives would bring him closer to the truth.\n\nI think it’s important to note that we don’t see a lot of Mari’s negatives. That doesn’t mean that Sunny didn’t love her or that Mari was a bad person. It means that most likely there were more of these “fights” between Mari and Sunny than we know of. Mari wasn’t perfect and fights breaking out between people, especially children and teenagers, are a common thing.\n\n# 5. Personal Thoughts & Opinions\n\n**Important Note**\n\nI’m not a psychiatrist or psychologist. The following chapters are ***not*** meant be seen as professional advice. They are simply my thoughts and experiences. How I experienced certain traumas and how I overcame them. What helped me and what not.\n\nIf you’re suffering from depression, please know that I’m not trying to disrespect or insult you in any kind of way in these chapters. Again, I’m just describing what and how I experienced things.\n\n**Losing Yourself**\n\nLosing control over yourself is one of the scariest things to me. I remember one specific time were I completely lost it. Though I was lucky enough that nothing bad happened. I was about 10 years old, walking home from school with my friends. We were looking at our baby photos, since we had to take some to school for making a birthday calendar. One of my friends accidentally got a small dent into my photo  the original, not a copy . I didn’t know how to react. But I knew that this dent would forever be there and that the photo could never be retaken again. I got so furious that I lashed out at him, pulling his hair as I lost myself. Luckily, my other friend pulled us apart and nobody got seriously injured.\n\nOf course, I would never forget this memory. I never attacked anyone before, majorly due to me being very weak as a child and knowing I didn’t stand a chance. And still, I knew I did that. I hurt a friend that I loved. The scary thing isn’t only that it happened. It’s knowing that it could happen again. That if I’m enraged enough, I can hurt the people I love. And just imagine how I would feel if there would have been some kind of permanent damage. This memory is the main reason I’m a pacifist today and try to avoid any kind of violence. Even stuff like hitting your desk in anger. Because I don’t ever want to loose control again.\n\nThis memory is also the reason why I understand why Sunny and Basil did what they did. They did it because they lost complete control over themselves. The Photo of Sunny pushing Mari reads “You lose all sense and push her down the staircase.” He lost it since it was too much for him to handle. The anger from playing an instrument that only caused him pain, coupled with Mari yelling at him and not understanding him. The weight of it all made him lose it and react irrationally. And after Sunny realized what he did, it got even worse. Having to deal with grief when you’re already at a weak point is too much to handle.\n\nI’m not trying to say it was okay what Sunny and Basil did. I’m saying that I understand ***why*** they did it. That there wasn’t any evil intent there. Just lost minds acting on their own.\n\n**Forgiving Sunny and Basil**\n\nWould I forgive Sunny and Basil for what they did? I think I would. I know it was an accident. The framing was a desperate act. I know how much pain they would cause themselves for what happened. And after 4 years of “living” with that pain, releasing Sunny and Basil from their torment is more than overdue.\n\nYet the problem is that this comes from an outside perspective. I wasn’t there spending time with Mari and the others. I wasn’t there when she supposedly committed suicide. I wasn’t Kel, Aubrey or Hero. I wasn’t Mari’s friend.\n\nIf you asked me if I would forgive someone for accidentally killing a close friend of mine and framing it as a suicide, I think I probably couldn’t forgive them. Even if I knew that it was an accident, that it happened years ago, that the framing was an act of sheer desperation and that I should forgive them, I don’t know if I could.\n\nI know that my grief would become even stronger than when I thought it was a suicide. I wouldn’t know what to think. I generally believe that forgiveness is very important, especially when there was no ill intent. But still, I don’t how I would react. Because every time I see that person, it’s a reminder that they were the one who killed my friend, even if it was an accident. Ultimately, I can’t answer if I could forgive somebody like Sunny or Basil. I can’t possibly know.\n\n**Acceptance and overcoming Depression**\n\nDepression has many causes. Most people who have depression didn’t kill a family member, obviously. Yet, a lot of depressions come from things that you do/did. From self-doubt. From lack of self-confidence. And of course from traumatic experiences. Sunny’s depression mostly came not only from the traumatic experience of losing his sister, but knowing that he was the cause of it.\n\nI myself faced depression as well. It was after I played Doki Doki Literature Club. One of the characters in the game, your childhood friend, commits suicide. It was traumatizing to me. Even though I’ve seen playthroughs of the game before, playing it myself was so different. It didn’t just make me aware of what depression is. It made me aware that people all around the world are suffering from it. It can be anybody. Even someone you know could be suffering from depression. Even somebody who seems happy on the outside.\n\nI was devastated. What kind of world is this to live in? A world full of pain and suffering? A lot of which is caused by our own kind? It was miserable to think about. I felt so weak since I couldn’t do anything about it. It got so bad that I desperately tried helping friends who had depression. Even if I could make them smile or laugh a little, I thought it would help me cope.\n\nObviously, it never did. The same thoughts would always come back to me. No matter what I did. Yet, after tons of suffering and painful experiences, I found my way out. By **accepting** the truth. By **accepting** that this is reality. **Accepting**, that the world is full of suffering. **Accepting**, that I’m just a human who can’t solve everything. It was that **acceptance**, that allowed me to move on.\n\nIt doesn’t mean that I should not care. I care much about the people I love. I still make an effort to make people laugh and smile. Not because it helps me cope, but because it makes me glad. I can never fully know how somebody’s feeling on a particular day. Which is why I like to make them smile. Even if its only a little, knowing that I can sweeten somebody’s day by a tiny bit makes me incredibly happy.\n\nAt the same time, I learned how to not care about things out of my reach. There simply are things I can’t do anything about. I can’t help everybody on the planet. I can’t cure depression or other severe illnesses. **But that’s okay**. It’s okay that I can’t solve everything. I am just a human, not some kind of god. This realization is another part that incredibly helped me. It helps me separate myself from problems where I am powerless. It helps me **accept** that I can’t change certain things.\n\nI’m well aware that acceptance isn’t always the cure and that it can feel unobtainable. That there are a ton of other things that can worsen your mental health. I’m going through something else right now that I haven’t been able to accept for most of my life. However, I would be lying if I said that acceptance hasn’t helped me a ton with my struggles.\n\n**The Beauty in Sadness**\n\nSadness is a common emotion of the brain. Sadness comes from various sources. The source that hits me the most is empathy. I’m an incredibly empathetic person. It helps me understand others better. At the same time, it’s also a weakness. Sad scenes in media can easily affect me. To help us cope with sadness, our brains make us cry. It releases stress and anxiety and helps us calm down.\n\nThough sadness is often a miserable thing, I learned that there is a certain beauty behind it. The show “Violet Evergarden” taught me that. In case you haven’t seen it, the show resolves around Violet, a young girl who grew up as an emotionless child. During the show, she doesn’t only learn what emotions are, but also what empathy is. And how important it is. A lot of the episodes are incredibly sad as they often include topics like loosing a loved one. Watching Violet Evergarden makes me cry, again and again. Yet, the sadness is not the reason why I’m watching it. It’s the beauty behind it.\n\nWhy is loosing a loved one sad? Because of the love itself. It wouldn’t be sad if the two people didn’t love each other. No matter if it was platonically or romantically. It’s the love the people shared for each other that makes it sad. That’s what makes it beautiful. Crying about loosing a loved one is a *testament* about how much you cared about that person. How much that person meant to you and how much you loved them.\n\nOf course, it’s still sad. But also beautiful. And that’s why I like these stories so much. I cried so hard when watching the final duet in Omori because I knew how much Sunny and Mari loved each other. I knew how incredibly painful it was for Sunny. Watching him and Mari grow up together with their smiles on their faces. It’s both heartwarming and dreadful. I haven’t cried that hard since watching Violet Evergarden. The combination of sadness and beauty is an indescribable feeling. One that I love to feel from time to time.\n\nI myself haven’t experienced loosing a loved one so far. And I’m afraid of the day it will happen. However, I’m sure that experiences like Omori will make it easier for me, even if just for a little.\n\n# 6. Conclusion\n\n**True Horror**\n\nI’m actually not a big fan of horror games. The main reason is because a ton of them use the same concepts. You run around in a pitch black area with a flashlight, getting chased by a monster that one shots you with a jumpscare. And you can’t do anything against it except hiding or stunning it. This concept is just boring to me. Aimlessly running around isn’t fun. And sure, jumpscares can be scary when you don’t expect them. Yet, it only scares me for a second and then everything is normal again.\n\nPsychological horror however, that’s interesting to me. I love the feeling of my own mind trying to piece things together. To be terrified by the horror and sad by the drama, at the same time. I want the horror to leave an impact on me. One that still holds after getting scared. One that leaves an imprint on my mind outside the game!\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club and Omori are the only games I’ve played so far that gave me those feelings. Horror is so much more impactful when you’re sad at the same time. Mourning the death of Mari while facing the horror of the Omori bossfight, it’s an indescribable feeling. Of course, I have to watch out that I don’t fall into depression.\n\nI first came across Omori randomly on YouTube. The algorithm showed me the newly released “Omori Preorder Promo” for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch releases. Though that trailer was very short, it was enough for me to know what I would get myself into. I added it to my favorites playlist, where I usually exclusively add short song pieces, and moved on. I knew I would eventually find it again in my playlist and I did so two weeks ago. I bought it and played through it in just 4 days. After finishing it, I was sad, but in the way I wanted. It’s the beauty and sadness combined what I love. That’s why I wanted to play Omori. ***That’s the Experience I seek!***\n\n**An Unforgettable Experience**\n\nThe game Omori does so many things right. It throws you into an intriguing story, walking around astounding places, fighting interesting bosses with your friends. Everything feels so well thought out. The music is always fitting, the character designs have a lot of thought behind them, the story makes you yearn for more answers etc.\n\nThough I haven’t come across Omori before seeing the promo trailer, I can tell by playing the game that it needed the long development time it did. Because you can’t give everything this much detail in one or two years. I’m incredibly glad that Omocat and the Team were able to finish this project. It’s an incredible game, an incredible **experience**, that I’ll never forget.\n\n**Thank you so much, Omocat and the Omori Team, for creating Omori!**\n\n**And thank you, dear reader, for reading my in depth review!** https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/15ea4vh/my_full_in_depth_omori_review_major_spoilers/",

   "body": "So I first played OMORI last October and have more or less been thinking about it ever since. I love the world (real and otherwise), the characters, and the juxtaposition of horror and cuteness, but now I'm wondering \\*why\\* exactly. What is it about the story that works as well as it does?\n\nFor me it's a combination of the nature of the core conflict and how relatively plausible it is. At the end of the day, OMORI isn't about Sunny and friends fighting some external force like EarthBound's Giygas or Mother 3's Pigmasks, but his own brain and his own actions. The player isn't asking \"what bad thing are the bad guy(s) about to do next?\" when going through the game, but \"what horrors lie within the consciousness of our own protagonist?\" That's not a premise I encounter as much personally, so it really impressed me with how Omocat wrote it.\n\nThe core conflict then gets better due to how much of OMORI could potentially happen to someone in our world. It's very possible to feel insecure in your friendships, and to get frustrated at, say, not playing a musical instrument as well as you want to. It's very possible to hurt someone you love by lashing out at the wrong place/time. It's very possible to stop going outside and to maladaptively daydream, even hallucinate based on intense trauma. And it's very possible to get lost in a deep depression and conclude that you deserve to die.\n\nI'm interested in hearing what you think works best about OMORI. I just got finished writing a big OMORI fanfiction that revolves around a similar conflict, and now I'm kinda stuck for ideas on how to write more without retreading the same ground too much. I keep having to shoot down ideas because I'll realize \"no, that's just Persona\" or \"no, that's just Stranger Things\", and that got me thinking about how OMORI the game is a fundamentally different story and wouldn't quite work with a similar premise.",

   "body": "I just beat Omori, the game and otherwise. TL;DR scary realization in the Whale\n\nNo game has scared me as much as Omori. The *amount and manner* of scared I was was completely different than anything I had ever experienced before. I don't experience depression or severe invasive thoughts on a common basis, but, like everyone, they appear here and there. This game portrays those thoughts so well through its visuals and soundtrack; it's horrifying.\n\nLet me lay some groundwork for that which happened that I found so unnerving. Throughout the journey of Headspace, Omori and friends go on fantastical adventures, just having fun while saving their friend. The first trip takes the party to space, where they help out and fight Space Ex-Boyfriend. The fight is light-hearted as the music is (I think) in major key and Space Ex-Boyfriend is like goofishly angry, having been disturbed from his sleep. The second trip takes the party through a forest to Sweetheart's castle; they get thrown in the dungeon of the castle - taking some *control* of the situation away from Omori and friends. After breaking free and confronting Sweetheart in the same kinda goofy way as Space Ex-Boyfriend, the party goes to the Deep Well. Here, they are forced to sign away their *freedom and control* (to a literal loan Shark lmao). A couple more goofy antics ensue, then we get to Deeper Well.\n\nHere is where I am psychologized out of my wits. As Omori and friends continue to adventure, they begin to forget why they were adventuring in the first place and about Basil entirely. \"Oh, saving the world now, are we?\" Mari points out during a picnic. They're losing sight of their goal. For the next area, Humphrey, the antagonism is brought about by Sweetheart once again, as she forces the Slime girls to make her suitor. In the following battle with the Slime girls, more stakes are on the line. They will tear your limbs off and sell them. The music here is high energy and serious. There is no goofing around here. Upon winning the fight, you now are fighting against being eaten by the whale you've been venturing around in.\n\nHumphrey's fight signifies how off-the-rails your journey has become. Your group was looking for their friend, now they're being eaten by a whale. The music is filled with dread; the light around you is dwindling; the air is becoming sparse. It's a bunch of kids fighting for their lives in the fricking **belly of the beast.** \n\nThe continued themes of losing control, losing sight of your goal and focus, and losing your loved ones culminated in a truly horrifying realization to me during that Whale fight. I was afraid of that. I was very afraid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a good game.",

   "body": "So I'm right off the heels of finishing up my first playthrough of this game and I understand why so many people enjoy and love this game because I feel the same way, I love the art, the music, the gameplay, the bosses, the funny moments, and parts of the story. There's so many things I'd like to say about this game but I can't find the words or ways to say them but I will say this after finishing the good ending I feel like I don't need to replay this game, I feel like it was a one-time experience I'll probably never play again because it kind of diminishes the value of my first playthrough in my eyes, I have heard that there are multiple endings and routes that you can go through and they all have separate endings and stuff like that, but I truly don't need to see them to understand why this game is so different from all the other games I've ever played. Mind you this is coming from a person that has barely played any horror games let alone any psychological horror games. But What I feel about this game is that it's a very sad, upsetting, and pretty depressing plot about a boy who accidentally killed his own sister and uses his own imagination to escape from it for four entire years until the day he finally steps out of his own home and sees (after a few days being with his old friends) that he no longer needs to keep this within his chest and decides to tell his old friends about it as well as the fact that he also harmed one of his closest friends (basil) with this ending them both in the hospital after trying to save him. (as I stated I got the good ending so this is my feelings about that ending not the others) This game has shaped how I feel about many topics, I see this as a good thing, and playing this game is an experience I hope to never forget.",

   "body": "A while ago I learned that Spotify applies certain variables to each song in its catalog, including beats per minute and popularity. Some of them are strange, though. My favorite is the \"valence\" variable, which seems to be Spotify's best guess at how happy a song is (quote taken from [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-music-mood-of-a-song-with-deep-learning-c3ac2b45229e)):\n\n>A measure... describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. **Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g.  happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).**\n\nI don't know exactly how it's calculated, or anything like that.\n\nWhether the OMORI soundtrack [that's currently on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3SDU0tsnoMO841qeOHlP8B) is official or not, we can now see Spotify's variables for OMORI songs. The only way I know how to do this is through a website called [PlaylistMachinery,](http://sortyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/index.html) so I'll be using that for reference. **On PlaylistMachinery, valence is displayed from 0-100 (Low = negative/less happy, high = positive/more happy).**\n\n# What Spotify thinks are the 10 most positive OMORI songs:\n\n1. \\[003\\] [Lost At A Sleepover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLDull8aPDw&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=3) (valence value of 100)\n2. \\[055\\] [High Fructose Headache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3jZEHAEIDA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=55)\n3. \\[002\\] [WHITE SPACE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVHR_1fS5k&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=2)\n4. \\[029\\] [Good for Health, Bad for Imagination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeK_I0XQW6U&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=29)\n5. \\[041\\] [Such a Time We Had Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHGonUUMeO8&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=41)\n6. \\[044\\] [Where We Used To Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DepK5YBmWfA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=44)\n7. \\[100\\] [Not-so-empty House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6E18KHYZE8&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=100)\n8. \\[145\\] [Friends.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4cMYqiOng&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=145)\n9. \\[007\\] [100 Sunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10rFQMp9cjE&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=7)\n10. \\[015\\] [Tussle Among Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWxiVN9eWVY&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=15) (valence value of 97)\n\n# What Spotify thinks are the 10 most negative OMORI songs:\n\n1. \\[170\\] [Try Again Little Brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyRzl8zVWE&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=170) (valence value of 0)\n2. \\[016\\] [A Place by a Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khr33grtujE&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=16)\n3. \\[174\\] [Wake Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VArqmDh2QpY&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=174)\n4. \\[162\\] [Your Catastrophes - Procession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rWV5JRd4zA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=162)\n5. \\[157\\] [Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k52DxtnNcA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=157)\n6. \\[143\\] [White Pillars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daT8cW5Nv7A&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=143)\n7. \\[134\\] [Drone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tPpbqFwtI&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=134)\n8. \\[119\\] [Gross...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2WrhtU-7uo&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=119)\n9. \\[097\\] [Origin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnu0ygZ4tvk&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=97)\n10. \\[057\\] [Just Leave Me Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEzbdsyaNao&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=57) (valence value of 3)\n\nThe draw of making this post for me was that playing through a game necessarily gives certain connotations to songs that may not be present in the music itself. Does Spotify think DUET is sad? It gives it a 7 for valence, so yeah, it likely does. But it's *DUET*. It probably means something more to you than that.\n\nOther times, one player may have a completely different emotional reaction to a song compared to someone else, just based on how it sounds. Even out of the context of the game, I think Where We Used to Play is a pretty depressing song; you might consider it to be calming instead.\n\nAbove all, I wanted to see if this sort of list, generated by an AI who can't have played the game, would spark some discussion. Maybe you think it's got it all wrong, but maybe its lists actually match up well with your idea of your own. Let me know what you think!",

The only way I know how to do this is through a website called  PlaylistMachinery,  http://sortyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/index.html  so I'll be using that for reference. **On PlaylistMachinery, valence is displayed from 0-100  Low = negative/less happy, high = positive/more happy .**\n\n# What Spotify thinks are the 10 most positive OMORI songs:\n\n1. \\ 003\\   Lost At A Sleepover  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLDull8aPDw&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=3   valence value of 100 \n2. \\ 055\\   High Fructose Headache  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3jZEHAEIDA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=55 \n3. \\ 002\\   WHITE SPACE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtVHR_1fS5k&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=2 \n4. \\ 029\\   Good for Health, Bad for Imagination  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeK_I0XQW6U&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=29 \n5. \\ 041\\   Such a Time We Had Together  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHGonUUMeO8&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=41 \n6. \\ 044\\   Where We Used To Play  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DepK5YBmWfA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=44 \n7. \\ 100\\   Not-so-empty House  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6E18KHYZE8&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=100 \n8. \\ 145\\   Friends.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4cMYqiOng&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=145 \n9. \\ 007\\   100 Sunny  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10rFQMp9cjE&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=7 \n10. \\ 015\\   Tussle Among Trees  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWxiVN9eWVY&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=15   valence value of 97 \n\n# What Spotify thinks are the 10 most negative OMORI songs:\n\n1. \\ 170\\   Try Again Little Brother  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyRzl8zVWE&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=170   valence value of 0 \n2. \\ 016\\   A Place by a Lake  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khr33grtujE&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=16 \n3. \\ 174\\   Wake Up  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VArqmDh2QpY&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=174 \n4. \\ 162\\   Your Catastrophes - Procession  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rWV5JRd4zA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=162 \n5. \\ 157\\   Something  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k52DxtnNcA&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=157 \n6. \\ 143\\   White Pillars  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daT8cW5Nv7A&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=143 \n7. \\ 134\\   Drone  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tPpbqFwtI&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=134 \n8. \\ 119\\   Gross...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2WrhtU-7uo&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=119 \n9. \\ 097\\   Origin  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnu0ygZ4tvk&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=97 \n10. \\ 057\\   Just Leave Me Alone  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEzbdsyaNao&list=PLbANFjAlbtqLkcthrPJ7lqYcVTSwXr2L0&index=57   valence value of 3 \n\nThe draw of making this post for me was that playing through a game necessarily gives certain connotations to songs that may not be present in the music itself. Does Spotify think DUET is sad? It gives it a 7 for valence, so yeah, it likely does. But it's *DUET*. It probably means something more to you than that.\n\nOther times, one player may have a completely different emotional reaction to a song compared to someone else, just based on how it sounds. Even out of the context of the game, I think Where We Used to Play is a pretty depressing song; you might consider it to be calming instead.\n\nAbove all, I wanted to see if this sort of list, generated by an AI who can't have played the game, would spark some discussion. Maybe you think it's got it all wrong, but maybe its lists actually match up well with your idea of your own.

   "body": "OMORI is a game that I never expected to show up in my life. It caught me by surprise when I've first played it without having any sort of knowledge about the game, except OMORI and BASIL. I don't know how to start this love letter off without appreciating everything the game has to offer for the player. In this case, I'm the player, and many doors opened for me when I took time to play this.\n\nI've stumbled upon OMORI on September 21, 2022. At the time, I was going through a breakup that happened in 2021, but I couldn't move on from it. I've asked a friend about the game, and they told me to buy it. So i did, and I don't regret it. \n\nOMORI made me open my eyes to reality and finally set my things up. The game carries a positive message. It's to grieve and overcome through tough situations. I was going through a horrible situation in 2021, up until the entirety of 2022. I was grieving over a relationship that I had in 2021 that was really hard for me to get over. I got carried away over the relationship. It got me obese. I felt horrible, I never wanted to see anybody. I hated going to school and seeing my past partner. Everything for me was... extremely unfair. Everything was crumbling in 2022 until I found OMORI.\n\nSUNNY and BASIL are characters that I've felt connected ever since I started playing the game. SUNNY is a character that doesn't show his emotions. Every hardship he's had has been bottled. He's a plain, simple kid. He's your average bland kid, yet he shines the most out of the group in OMORI. BASIL is more of a personality thing. He has a very kind personality, and he puts selflessness over selfishness. He's a gentle character, but... he doesn't know how to control his emotions. People see BASIL as an inferior character for his very gentle personality and... I've found myself to be more like him. My life in 2022 has felt like I'm both SUNNY and BASIL for the grieving they've gone through. \n\nOMORI's beginning, plot, music, group, and pacing eventually hit me after my first blind playthrough. This game has impacted me because of its SUNNY ROUTE. SUNNY ROUTE is a route where you wake up from the WHITE SPACE and go with your friends for a last time. The SUNNY ROUTE helped me open my eyes to see a brighter future for myself. \n\nSUNNY's grieving progress on the last moments of the game and his friends' raw emotions is something that i cherish to my heart. I see the characters from OMORI as... the 5 stages of grief. \n\nSUNNY being DENIAL, AUBREY being ANGER, BASIL being BARGAINING, HERO as DEPRESSION and KEL as ACCEPTANCE\n\nI've felt all of this except acceptance. I've felt the characters' true emotions, and I've felt this way so many times. I've been in denial so many times. Nothing for me helped, I always kept falling back to denial, then bargaining. It's a mix of emotions to a point where all of my emotions threw up for just a beautiful relationship that I've ruined. I see myself in SUNNY because I've ruined everything for the time, and I was miserable. I locked myself away from people, and I've distanced myself from many people. I seeked a home in SUNNY for how he is in the game. Until he chose to overcome his problems. OMORI puts trauma in a beautiful and accurate way. What makes it more beautiful is SUNNY's overcoming. OMORI's final boss is what has hit me the most, SUNNY fights against himself. He fights against OMORI to finally overcome his hardships with BASIL, AUBREY, KEL, HERO, and MARI being his biggest supporters. \n\nThe OMORI boss fight from beginning to end is bone-chilling, and the many tears that my eyes have thrown up for how incredible the boss, the music, and the message that carries is. He fights himself to stay true. He fights himself not to end up in stage 1 again. He fights himself for his sister. I fought myself to stay true. I fought myself to not end up in stage 1 again. I fought myself because I've finally learned how to fight myself, thanks to OMORI.\n\nI fought so much alone without having anybody by my side. It made me more independent and true to myself. So many times that I've been beaten down by people and myself into believing that I'd be nothing, finally came to a good result. Change happens. There is nothing that people can do to avoid change. I was destroyed when everything was changing for my friends and my previous partner. I've cried so much. I've layed down on my bed with my eyes drenched in tears. My mouth dry. My body gaining weight and fat. I've lost motivation when change happened. My room became my WHITE SPACE. It had to happen eventually, and thankfully, I've moved on past that with OMORI being by my side. I've finally risen and proved to myself that I am better than I was. \n\nOMORI inspired me to move on. OMORI inspired me to lose 50 pounds. OMORI inspired me to connect with people. OMORI made me realize that I'm not perfect. OMORI made me realize that I'm human.\n\nI'm human. We make horrible mistakes. Mistakes are beautiful for humans, as they make us grow and overcome. I haven't realized that until now.\n\nI am grateful to ever spend money on OMORI not knowing what would happen inside the game. I am grateful that OMORI opened my eyes. I am grateful that OMORI is now something important that I carry in my heart. I am grateful that OMORI is in my heart forever for the things that I've learned from it.\n\nThank you, OMORI, for turning me into the person that I am today.\n\nThank you, OMOCAT.",

   "title": "Similarities with OMORI and veil by Balloon MV (aka Fire Force ending 1)",
   "body": "If you finished OMORI,  I suggest you watch this MV of veil by Balloon (with subtitles for lyrics) :\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VZxg9pxkg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VZxg9pxkg)\n\nIf you've heard this song before, it was used in the anime Fire Force as 1st ending\n\nThis clip was made by avogado6 with his unique and depressive drawing style and matches the lyrics of the song. \n\nAt first, I didn't understand the MV or watch the lyrics. Then I saw this comment by Derpycows671  who explains and interprets the clip :\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VZxg9pxkg&lc=UgyaoFfd5ik3gark2bZ4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VZxg9pxkg&lc=UgyaoFfd5ik3gark2bZ4AaABAg)\n\nTo summarize very briefly his comment :\n\nThe song is about losing a loved one. The protagonist dreams a lot of his past memories which are in the form of common objects. The 1st day we saw the protagonist's routine. That's when tragedy strikes. The 2nd day the protagonist is covered with a blue strip on his face, representing sadness. That's when his memories became painfull so he wants to get rid of them by crushing them with the palm of his hand. Then his head is buried in water, representing a deep state of depression. When he returns to sleep he is plunged into a deep ocean. The loved one materializes in his dream to tell the protagonist to stop mourning and let it go. The water that buried his head drips down with the last drop being a tear, like a last goodbye. His memories are preserved, he wakes up without the blue strip on his face. His sadness is gone.\n\n(You can read the entire comment for more details)\n\nMy mind was blown away. This became my favourite song from Balloon and one of the best ending song used in anime. The similarities with OMORI resemblances are obviously the stages of mourning a loved one but also the dreams, the past memories and maybe guilt ? The deep dive into the ocean could also be a parallel of DEEPER WELL of BLACK SPACE ? To clarify : OMORI and Veil are different but share similarities. Surely by the universality of mourning a loved one. I just hope you find my analysis relevant. If you find other similarities don't hesitate to leave a comment below.\n\nI wanted to share this beautiful music because watching this clip before playing OMORI allowed me to appreciate the experience more. OMORI and Veil have the same vibe but they are clearly 2 unique pieces !",

Then I saw this comment by Derpycows671  who explains and interprets the clip :\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VZxg9pxkg&lc=UgyaoFfd5ik3gark2bZ4AaABAg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7VZxg9pxkg&lc=UgyaoFfd5ik3gark2bZ4AaABAg \n\nTo summarize very briefly his comment :\n\nThe song is about losing a loved one. The protagonist dreams a lot of his past memories which are in the form of common objects. The 1st day we saw the protagonist's routine. That's when tragedy strikes. The 2nd day the protagonist is covered with a blue strip on his face, representing sadness. That's when his memories became painfull so he wants to get rid of them by crushing them with the palm of his hand. Then his head is buried in water, representing a deep state of depression. When he returns to sleep he is plunged into a deep ocean. The loved one materializes in his dream to tell the protagonist to stop mourning and let it go. The water that buried his head drips down with the last drop being a tear, like a last goodbye. His memories are preserved, he wakes up without the blue strip on his face. His sadness is gone.\n\n You can read the entire comment for more details \n\nMy mind was blown away. This became my favourite song from Balloon and one of the best ending song used in anime. The similarities with OMORI resemblances are obviously the stages of mourning a loved one but also the dreams, the past memories and maybe guilt ? The deep dive into the ocean could also be a parallel of DEEPER WELL of BLACK SPACE ? To clarify : OMORI and Veil are different but share similarities. Surely by the universality of mourning a loved one. I just hope you find my analysis relevant. If you find other similarities don't hesitate to leave a comment below.\n\nI wanted to share this beautiful music because watching this clip before playing OMORI allowed me to appreciate the experience more. OMORI and Veil have the same vibe but they are clearly 2 unique pieces ! https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/lowbmp/similarities_with_omori_and_veil_by_balloon_mv/",

   "body": "&#x200B;\n\n***(WARNING!: SPOILERS! ALSO THIS IS MY OPINION AND INTERPATION OF THIS GAME. I AM NOT ATTACKING YOU OR YOUR LIKING OF THIS GAME!!! I DO NOT MEAN TO CAUSE PROBLEMS, MERELY PRESENT MY PERSPECTIVE!!!!)***\n\nThis review has been four years in the making\n\nIn the history of the world, no game has ever been more glazed than the \"psychological\" \"RPG\" and \"HORROR\" \"GAME\" of Omori. Short for \"Hikkomori\" this supposed game was released in 2020 after over 7 years of development. That's strike one. This \"game\" is a shallow hollow-less husk clone of Earthbound, and just as mid as that game too.\n\nNow, let me give you a small plot summary of this product (spoilers, of course :D)  \n\n\nSunny, the protagonist accidentally pushed his sister, Mari, down the stairs because of an upcoming duet Sunny was not ready for. His best friend, Basil, was there but did not witness the incident, and offered the idea to frame her death as a suicide. After her funeral, all of the friends disband and went down their own path. Sunny, due to the overbearing trauma and misery, forcefully forget about the truth of Mari's death by his hand. Eventually, all his memories turned into dreams. Omori, the personification of Sunny's trauma and repression, became responsible for protecting his mind from the horrors of the truth. Sunny would spend all his time indoors, eating, using the bathroom, and sleeping. After 4 years, one of his other closest friends, Kel, disturbs this endless cycle. Sunny begins his path of uncovering the truth and forgiving himself for what he has done from here.\n\nNow look, ive watched flawed storylines before, such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, 3, New Vegas, Far Cry 6, and some more. But in those games, I was at least invested within ***some*** of the characters and storylines even if the overall story was mid or below. Even then, some lines and moments within those rather weak or underwhelming stories were very well made and generally gave me emotions and impacted me.\n\nHowever, in Omori... I have ***NEVER*** cared so little about a group of characters. Sunny (our main protagonist) is a shallow pathetically written character that has no development at all throughout the entire story. Basil is a whiny, annoying character that makes my teeth grind when he dare appear on my damn screen. Aubrey is a woman. Kel is... okay. Hero is a half-baked, meek, and horrifically written character. He is the very reason why Ive always hated characters like him ever since ive touched this game. Mari is also underbaked and badly written. She is also dead for like half the story.\n\nThe story is a complete slog to go through, you spend so much time dicking around in headspace that the Real life sections (which are like 3-4 hours max of content, most of which consists of meaningless yap) and these lines, **OH MY GOODNESSSSS!** they suck!\n\nThe final stretch of this story is mid, no.. not just mid. STINKY. these parts made me want to end it all. Basically, its revealed that you killed your sister by pushing down the stairs on accident and whatever and then you yap. BORING AND MID!!!!!!! I have never in my life been so confused about a \"plot twist\" in a game.\n\nNow, I got the \"good ending\" the first time.. and ill admit. the Final duet, that... made me cry...\n\nBesides that, everything else about was trash.\n\nNow **for Gameplay**\n\nOmori is an RPG maker game so the main gameplay of Omori consists of earthbound, top down, pixel, RPG elements with party elements blended in together. sound interesting right? well...\n\nThe gameplay, is trash to me. Look, i play mostly shooters and first-person RPGs and I grew up with those types of games so what I will say will mostly like come from my personal biases and my interests that have been molded by what games I grew up with. But, I have played games outside my comfort zone before, like coffee talk, and Animal Crossing (mostly cause a girl I had a crush on played it) and I enjoyed those games.\n\nOmori is outside my comfort zone area thing and I dislike it. The gameplay is repetitive and disgustingly simple. You enter combat, use skill moves, and win or lose. Horry! awful. now a review I watched back when the game came out in 2020 said \"If you like Pokemon you will most likely love Omori\" and I love Pokemon so I thought \"Oh! this game will be awesome!\" NOPE! The gameplay just sucks and it feels dull and not rewarding. Ive always hated it. Now, I do admit I like the item, weapons, and toys system. and some of the combat was aight.\n\nNow onto the \"philosophy\" part of this game... it's trash. Now, due to my previous section, you may be thinking \"Oh... he doesn't like RPG maker games so he probably doesn't like philosophical stuff right?\" somewhat, I don't really like **LIKE** philosophical games and media but i do like my good amount of it. I watch Evangelion, Lain, and Hello Kitty which are pretty philosophical stuff and I liked them. Mostly Evangelion cause of the robot fights but Lain was good too.\n\nBut the \"philosophy\" content of omori is... just trash. Just AWFUL! Its the most cookie-cutter \"depression bad\" stuff ever! And some \"dont hide your emotions and feelings through a mask!\" crap. Both are valid points but dear goodness I get it man! every single piece of content with \"philosophy\" thrown in has those same themes. Even the previously mentioned Evangelion and Lain. But they do it in a more creative and better-written way than Omori does.\n\nThis is celeste level stuff man.\n\nNow to my final point for this review, the music is all aight. Now my cup of tea, but it's okay. Final Duet, good morning, and Remembrance are my favorite tracks.\n\n***CONCLUSION***\n\nWe are in the zenith of the Human age, Omori stands as a shining example of the disaster to come. it's a shallow, pathetic, flaccid, and miserable experience that has been praised like it's some \"masterpiece\". If you enjoy this game, That's okay. I just mildly dislike this game.\n\n**For every Omori fan, I want you to tell me your points and why I'm wrong. I really really want to like this game and enjoy it fully. Open my eyes to what I was wrong about, I could be wrong on all of my points about the gameplay, writing, story, characters, and philosophy of OMORI. Please give me your opinions**\n\nOmori gets my official rating of 3/10.",

   "title": "I finished Omori yesterday, and it broke me",
   "body": "I don't really write posts like these like... ever, but after finishing the game yesterday, it left me with a lot of feelings, some that I'm sure most of the people who've played it here are familiar with and that I simply need to share. This post is in no means meant to be an analysis or going into deeper aspects of the game, I just want to share my thoughts about the game and how it affected me. For context: I finished the good ending of the game, watched the other endings through a video and I'm currently working on going through several analysis and other content I missed during my playthrough.\n\nI'd heard the name Omori pass by a few times, but it never really piqued my interest before. I don't remember what caused me to put it on my Steam wishlist, but I did only a few weeks ago. When it was time for the winter sale, I was doubting between getting \"What remains of Edith Finch\" and \"Omori\". My best friend urged me to get Omori instead, something that I'm grateful for after finishing the game.\n\nWhen I started playing Omori, I went in 100% blind. The only thing I knew is that it featured topics of depression, but I had somehow managed to miss all the other warnings at the start of the game or the fact it was a psychological horror game. Luckily, I'm not very sensitive to subjects like that, so it was all good, but it only meant that I was less prepared for what was about to come. The first one to one and a half hour of the game, though, I was kind of bored and confused. I knew the game was about depression, but at that point all I'd gotten was an introduction to who Omori was, to what White Space and Head Space was (although not in depth, but I was getting familiarized with the concept), who my friends were and basically a tutorial. The darker aspects of the game were nowhere to be seen and not knowing how long this game was, I thought it was dragging on quite a bit. That was, until I reached Basil's house.\n\nWith the cheery background music and the colorful display of Head Space and my friends, it was easily forgotten that Omori was, in fact, a psychological horror game. I was quickly reminded of that when the first jumpscare happened and I had to throw my headphones off as it caught me completely off guard. I'd been thrown back into White Space where I was completely lost on what to do, just wandering around aimlessly and trying to interact with things. It wasn't until my friend told me to try opening the menu and that I saw \"stab\" that my stomach twisted uncomfortably. Surely the game wouldn't do that, right?! Alas, it was the only way to move forward, and I was absolutely horrified to use stab on Omori... on myself. As unsure I was to whether I wanted to continue playing this game before, the more my interest was piqued with this sudden turn of events. I wanted to keep playing, desperately so.\n\nI won't do a whole recap of the game or go deeper into the plot of the story as I'm sure everyone that's on this subreddit either played the game themselves or watched a playthrough of it and knows the premise of the story. I do however want to take a moment to talk about what my expectations of the story were. As said, I went into this game 100% blind, but as the story progressed, I started creating my own expectations of how it was going to go. After learning that Mari had passed away (I only learnt this after going outside with Kel, as I hadn't opened the door for Mari on the first night), I didn't quite connect the dots with the warning at the start of the game regarding suicide. I was constantly left wondering what had happened to Mari, and I thought that this game was about grief and acceptance of death. The actual truth left me far more broken than that.\n\nAt this point, I'd formed a connection to Omori and Sunny. Whenever I talked to my friends about the game, I referred to them as \"I\". It felt as if Aubrey, Kel, Hero and Basil were my friends and that I was figuring out how to deal with the death of my sister. It was amazing how I could form a connection like this with a non-existent fictional character, and at the same time it made the rest of the path all the more heavy. With the expectations of the story I'd created inside my head, I assumed that the main goal of the game was to find Basil and deal with this loss together. Instead, new characters and worlds kept appearing, boss fights needed to be fought and puzzles needed to be solved. To me, it felt like obstacles toward my true goal: finding Basil. Little did I know that I shouldn't have wanted to find him.\n\nIt's important to note that I did miss quite a few things during my playthrough. I didn't get to see Daddy Longlegs or the keeper of the castle, I found out they existed and how they related to the story through YouTube videos. Still, I don't think it took away from the experience of the game. I might've missed some lore about what Head Space exactly was and how it came to be, but the core premise of the story remained and I'm frankly still excited to learn about all these things I've missed out on so far.\n\nOmori has made me gasp when I first had to stab Omori to return to the real world, it's made me fear things that I'm not typically (that) afraid of, such as the spider section, and it's made me cry after learning that Mari took her own life and seeing her happy with Hero in the picture album, but the most important part is that when it was time to learn the truth, this game has taken a hold of my soul, my heart and my very being, and squeezed tight.\n\nAs I made my way through Black Space, gathering the pictures and piecing the truth together, I felt despair. I was hoping, praying, that this wasn't the actual truth. Surely, Sunny couldn't have done something like that, especially not on purpose. It was an accident, it must've been, maybe a fake truth that Basil wanted to give to us, to make things less bad but... it made things worse. It was the truth and there was no denying it, not with the pictures, the broken violin. I do believe it was an accident, though. At this time, I don't and can't understand what compelled them to make her death look like a suicide. It's something I'd never be able to do if I was in either of their positions and I'm grateful that I'll never have to be. Alas, I can't understand their minds, but that is something I like a lot about this game too.\n\nI really enjoyed that the game forces Sunny to reflect on himself. He can't move forward unless he accepts what happened and accepts that he needs to tell the truth to his friends (and possibly his parents if they didn't already know?) and that is okay to keep those happy memories by going down Memory Lane while repairing his violin, repairing himself. I think that Omori is an extremely powerful game when it comes to the narrative, as the plot twist completely caught me off guard and caused me to feel such a mixture of emotions. The entire game gave me emotional whiplash as it bounced between Head Space, White Space, reality and more, something I've never experienced before through any other game.\n\nI think a big part of why the game hits so hard is also because it all takes place in so little time. In the game world, it's been 4 years since Mari's death and yet we're processing all of those repressed thoughts, memories and feelings in just 3 days. For the player, it's even less. We experience 4 years and 3 days in just a matter of hours. I finished the game in 17 hours, less than a day, and all that information, all those emotions and feelings were just thrust onto me. It is a lot to handle.\n\nTo say that Omori changed my perspective on reality is maybe a little bit much, but to say that it changed my perspective on how mental health is portrayed in video games is just right. This game has done an amazing job in making me live in Sunny's world for just a moment and I have to give Omori all the credit that it deserves. Between the soundtrack, the art style and the story, it is overall just a masterpiece that I wish anyone can experience, and even though I know I can never replay this game (for comfort reasons and story reasons), I know for a fact that I at least am not quite done with this game yet.",

The entire game gave me emotional whiplash as it bounced between Head Space, White Space, reality and more, something I've never experienced before through any other game.\n\nI think a big part of why the game hits so hard is also because it all takes place in so little time. In the game world, it's been 4 years since Mari's death and yet we're processing all of those repressed thoughts, memories and feelings in just 3 days. For the player, it's even less. We experience 4 years and 3 days in just a matter of hours. I finished the game in 17 hours, less than a day, and all that information, all those emotions and feelings were just thrust onto me. It is a lot to handle.\n\nTo say that Omori changed my perspective on reality is maybe a little bit much, but to say that it changed my perspective on how mental health is portrayed in video games is just right. This game has done an amazing job in making me live in Sunny's world for just a moment and I have to give Omori all the credit that it deserves. Between the soundtrack, the art style and the story, it is overall just a masterpiece that I wish anyone can experience, and even though I know I can never replay this game  for comfort reasons and story reasons , I know for a fact that I at least am not quite done with this game yet. https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/18vy4cu/i_finished_omori_yesterday_and_it_broke_me/",

I got the Good Ending and overall I'm pretty satisfied with my run even though I did leave at least 7 sidequests unfinished in Headspace. \n\nI do have one complaint though: I feel like Sunny accidentally killing Mari lessened the emotional punch of what was up to that point a pretty intense story. The old \"I accidentally killed someone so let's frame it as suicide\" bit? Ehhhhhhh. I was really enjoying this tale of a kid who has a perfect image of his sister in his mind, but there were hints that she had demons--at one point she said she was given advice from a shadow, which is ominous, and there was also the perfectionist aspect, as well as that looming (supposed) knowledge that she had killed herself. I was thinking the Something was going to be that Mari was secretly disturbed somehow, not just that Sunny pushed her down some stairs. I guess it was necessary to tie in Basil's distress, but he could have been plenty distressed from just being with Sunny when they saw Mari's body hanging and having taken the photos out of shock. Idk, I found it pretty disappointing.\n\nBUT! \n\nThe story was still very good at hitting the emotions regardless of that. Putting flowers at Mari's grave with all the kids grown up was ~*chef's kiss*~. The cut from teenage badass Aubrey where you fucking stab her (at least I did lol) to headspace memory version where she has a crush on Sunny, ugh that hurt. The overall theme of childhood friends drifting apart and things changing (and just depression in general ofc) was fantastic. \n\nSo many great details too. My favorite is that Sunny/Omori has such basic observations about the world (\"It's a desk lamp.\") but when you get to that final memory of the time before Mari passed he elaborates on everything and is much more descriptive. That's a good touch! The artwork, character designs, landscapes, and the variety of settings was insane in the greatest way possible. The music is perfect, such a great pairing OST; even the Title Screen updates based on where you are in the game. \n\nSimply put, it's a super well polished, well written, well designed game.

I'm too curious\" and clicking out of the video. I proceeded to play 30 hours of the game in 4 days, spending all of my free time on it. I was absolutely hooked.

   "title": "Finished the game and W-O-W (spoilers)",
   "body": "So when I first finished the game, I got the neutral ending where Sunny stabs himself in bed : ( Back then I didn't realise there were multiple endings, and whilst I was really impressed with the game (the soundtrack was incredible especially the battle themes, See You Tomorrow and Finding Shapes In The Clouds, the sketchy art style was gorgeous and worked seamlessly with both the cute and the horror, the depiction of how everyone dealt with their greif - especially Aubrey, Sunny and Basil - was executed fantastically, and the twist of what \"Something\" was and how we piece together the truth was maybe the most powerful reveal I have ever experienced in a story in its execution)... I did feel the ending was kinda anticlimactic, if realistic! But then my friend (who reccommended the game to me) sent me a save file with the true ending and... wow. Wow wow wow.\n\nI can't put into words how the Memory Lane bit made me feel... maybe like an aching beauty? I have a big fear of losing friends and loved ones as time goes on, and the music and dialogue and the fact that all the memories were linked to Basil's photos hit me right there >.< And that final boss fight, oh my word... that has to be the most emotional final boss I have ever experienced! I'm a huge fan of when big climactic moments that would usually have action or hype music over them have more emotional tracks (the ending sequence of The Last of Us in the hospital being another great example of this) and the Omori fight was an amazing execution of this, even ignoring the amazing symbolism of the violin! The subtle but chilling dialogue change from \"did not succumb\" to \"will not succumb\" was ingenious and creepy as hell, him getting more and more bloody as it goes on, the depiction of depressive thoughts, to the finale where Sunny hugs Omori as if to say \"thank you for helping me cope for the past several years, but... it's time for me to move on from you now\" all culminated in one of the most emotional climaxes I've ever experienced (not to even mention the duet scene ;\\_;). Just... genuinely so powerful.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this exactly other than to just gush and maybe start conversation! But yeah\n\nI think the only thing I disliked about the game was just how much time we spent in headspace and how little time we spent in the real world... I know that is the point, Sunny desperately needed to retreat and spend lots of time there, but I was so engrossed in the real world stuff and the dream world stuff - whilst admittedly fun in its own right - felt like filler (ESPECIALLY around sweetheart's castle, it dragged on for such a long time and I had no investment in her arc or character at all). It felt like you could remove maybe 90% of the dreamworld content and lose almost nothing from the plot, and I wish also that there were more parallels between the real and dream worlds (whilst there are of course quite a few, they still feel very disconnected - again, this is accurate to how it would be for Sunny, but from a storytelling standpoint it did grind on me a bit). I don't wanna shit on the dream world entirely, the battle system and levels of charm there (quirky dialogue, amazing NPC designs, even little things like becoming toast) was all excellent, but... yeah haha. Still... utterly stunning game! Hope we see more from OMOCAT in the future, as it's been way too long since I've played a good RPG Maker horror game lol",

   "merged_text": "Finished the game and W-O-W  spoilers  So when I first finished the game, I got the neutral ending where Sunny stabs himself in bed :   Back then I didn't realise there were multiple endings, and whilst I was really impressed with the game  the soundtrack was incredible especially the battle themes, See You Tomorrow and Finding Shapes In The Clouds, the sketchy art style was gorgeous and worked seamlessly with both the cute and the horror, the depiction of how everyone dealt with their greif - especially Aubrey, Sunny and Basil - was executed fantastically, and the twist of what \"Something\" was and how we piece together the truth was maybe the most powerful reveal I have ever experienced in a story in its execution ... I did feel the ending was kinda anticlimactic, if realistic! But then my friend  who reccommended the game to me  sent me a save file with the true ending and... wow. Wow wow wow.\n\nI can't put into words how the Memory Lane bit made me feel... maybe like an aching beauty? I have a big fear of losing friends and loved ones as time goes on, and the music and dialogue and the fact that all the memories were linked to Basil's photos hit me right there >.< And that final boss fight, oh my word... that has to be the most emotional final boss I have ever experienced! I'm a huge fan of when big climactic moments that would usually have action or hype music over them have more emotional tracks  the ending sequence of The Last of Us in the hospital being another great example of this  and the Omori fight was an amazing execution of this, even ignoring the amazing symbolism of the violin! The subtle but chilling dialogue change from \"did not succumb\" to \"will not succumb\" was ingenious and creepy as hell, him getting more and more bloody as it goes on, the depiction of depressive thoughts, to the finale where Sunny hugs Omori as if to say \"thank you for helping me cope for the past several years, but... it's time for me to move on from you now\" all culminated in one of the most emotional climaxes I've ever experienced  not to even mention the duet scene ;\\_; . Just... genuinely so powerful.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this exactly other than to just gush and maybe start conversation! But yeah\n\nI think the only thing I disliked about the game was just how much time we spent in headspace and how little time we spent in the real world... I know that is the point, Sunny desperately needed to retreat and spend lots of time there, but I was so engrossed in the real world stuff and the dream world stuff - whilst admittedly fun in its own right - felt like filler  ESPECIALLY around sweetheart's castle, it dragged on for such a long time and I had no investment in her arc or character at all . It felt like you could remove maybe 90% of the dreamworld content and lose almost nothing from the plot, and I wish also that there were more parallels between the real and dream worlds  whilst there are of course quite a few, they still feel very disconnected - again, this is accurate to how it would be for Sunny, but from a storytelling standpoint it did grind on me a bit . I don't wanna shit on the dream world entirely, the battle system and levels of charm there  quirky dialogue, amazing NPC designs, even little things like becoming toast  was all excellent, but... yeah haha. Still... utterly stunning game! Hope we see more from OMOCAT in the future, as it's been way too long since I've played a good RPG Maker horror game lol https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/m7qbgs/finished_the_game_and_wow_spoilers/",

   "title": "Omori Music Analysis Post 3",
   "body": "Been a while since I last did one of these, because I was in a bit of a state. But I’m feeling better now, so let’s jump in~! I originally had an order planned for these, but I’m jumping straight to one of the ones that was towards the end of my list.\n\nAnd so, let’s do some analysis on the final boss theme: OMORI/OMORI-ALTER. I sort of group them as one due to how similar they are, so I’ll be referring to them as a single song for the most part in my analysis. I also briefly mention Duet at the end, along with a couple other brief songs from the ending.\n\nSo, obviously OMORI/OMORI-ALTER is a sad song. Right off the bat it hits you with an incredibly sad note on the violin. The note sort of wavers too (not sure of the proper musical term for this), almost as if the song itself is trying to hold its composure. This sad melody on the violin repeats constantly through the entire song, forming the backbone of the piece as more and more is added around it. I’ve said it before in comments on other posts, but this, to me, is a perfect metaphor for the depression that comes after a traumatic event. It stabs you right in the heart as you first encounter the trauma, and it’s all you can think about. You start losing yourself as more and more chaos happens around you because you’re chained down by that sadness. Eventually the chaos around you reaches a distorted screeching like in the OMORI-ALTER part of the song, but still, that initial trauma can be heard. No matter how far you go, you can never escape without facing what happened and overcoming it, and the longer you flounder the worse it gets, until you don’t even want to try anymore. You bury it and try not to think about it, but it is ALWAYS still there.\n\nObviously, this is a perfect metaphor for Sunny’s situation. By not facing his trauma for so long, it’s only built up, magnifying into something far, far worse. Omori, the entity tasked with suppressing the hard feelings whenever they erupted, has become extremely powerful because of how long Sunny has been running and using Headspace as a coping mechanism. And so, when repressing the truth is no longer an option, because Sunny destroyed the lightbulb that generated Headspace, all of that power Sunny gave away to Omori has nowhere to fight against, other than Sunny himself.\n\nThere’s a lot of other angles from which the final battle can be analyzed, though. Considering the second part of the song is called OMORI-ALTER, it’s possible that Omori has become more than just a coping mechanism for Sunny. In cases of Dissociative Identity Disorder, the separate personalities within the patient are sometimes referred to as “alters”. It is entirely possible that Omori could be a nascent “alter” developing within Sunny’s psyche. I am far from an expert on psychology, so what I say here should be taken with a grain of salt. But the possibility does exist that Omori has, in fact, become more than just Sunny’s coping mechanism, and has developed into the beginning of an entirely new identity. Considering that defeat at Omori’s hands leads to Sunny ceasing to exist (represented by seeing Omori in the mirror instead of Sunny in the hospital), I think it is certainly likely, although I would very much like someone with more knowledge on DID to either write a fuller analysis or correct me if I’m wrong.\n\nAnyway, returning to the song itself, the use of a violin specifically for the melody is important. Not only is it a fitting instrument for such a sad melody, it also calls back to Sunny’s initial trauma. The broken violin that began all this pain, causing the tragic accident. Sunny also wields his violin during the battle, facing the worst memory in his life as he tries to cling to the happy times, with the violin his friends worked so hard to give him.\n\nAnd then, the Duet comes. Sunny only triumphs and overcomes his traumatic feelings by remembering those cherished memories, and playing the violin in the way it never got to be played: by finally playing the duet he was supposed to play with Mari. That he would have played, if the accident hadn’t happened. He finally plays that recital he missed as a final farewell to his sister, coming to terms with her being gone, as he is flooded with memories of all the time he spent together with her and all of his friends. The Duet brings the themes of the game to a conclusion. The lonely title screen theme from before is finally given its proper context; as one half of a duet that never got to be played. By Sunny playing that Duet now, he completes the story, bringing everything home in an emotional conclusion. Instead of the painful sadness of the tragic violin that underlines OMORI/OMORI-ALTER, there is a beauty to the sad violin in the Duet. It is a celebration of what happened, even if it’s a little sad.\n\nAs a final note, Gone, Wake Up, and The Truth are nice little pieces that help bring things to a conclusion as well. Gone plays in the scene where Omori, who is no longer necessary because Sunny has overcome the truth, finally submits, dropping his knife and giving Sunny a hug as he ceases to exist. It has a dreamlike quality to it, and sort of feels like a farewell. Sunny used Omori for a long time, and even if a coping mechanism is problematic, it can be hard to say goodbye to it. Wake Up is a subtle and quiet song, feeling free, as Sunny does after finally reaching the point where he can break down and cry. And finally, The Truth, which plays as Sunny prepares to admit to what happened. It uses the same melody as the title screen and the Duet, but very briefly, and changes some notes in a way that sounds like asking a question. Interpretation of what that question might be could vary, but it’s a hopeful question. One that I interpret as meaning that anything could happen, now that Sunny is free.\n\nBut I digress. I have a lot of feelings about the music of OMORI, and maybe I’m not always the best at presenting them, but still, I’ll keep making these posts in the hopes that it inspires others or makes them smile, or think more deeply about this amazing game. I’ll try to do the next one a bit sooner, although I’m also working out designs for the cast in my fan-fic, so look forward to those, too. I hope you all enjoyed my analysis, even if I’m not really an expert~!",

   "title": "(MANY SPOILERS) Sharing my experience. And also how did you feel after playing and during playing game? How were you introduced to Omori?",
   "body": "Hello guys! Just curious about it. And also... sorry for baaad english (if it is.)\n\nHere's my experience if anyone is interested:\nI found about Omori completely randomly by catching trailer in my YouTube (recommendations. And it kinda blew my mind (amazing trailer with amazing song My Time that just ideally fits to this)\n\nAnd so then I played the game without knowing practically anything about it. My only knowledge was: 1. Probably it is horror 2. It may be emotional 3. It might be an amazing game, but I am not sure...\nAnd oh god. This game is sooo good. I did not expect it to become my favorite at the moment and for a long time (I think Omori will stay at this place for several years at least for me). I completed it in four days (to be honest, at first day I played about 1-2 hours, but at others I was  sucked into this, I couldn't take any break and I didn't even feel tired, despite I played about 8-9 hours at these days (weekend and also our school had Monday as day off for one time, so i spent completing Omori at this day also). I still remember my little shock when all the horror fun started to come (I mean first night, creepy atmosphere and also Hellmari with Something). Gosh, I am so excited (really sorry if my speech is becoming a mess, I am shivering because of my delightedness). Everything was so good and all elements of game (art,\nmusic, gameplay, story, characters and ect) made with love and soul. Though the game was rather long and had a lot of elements,\nOmori could entertain me for all my 25 hours (gameplay is really cool and very interesting, having a big variety of things), and even after this I am excited to watch gameplays of other people (I suggested my friend to play it and I watched and helped him with playing it (maybe I should did it, but he wasn’t against so...)), look and laugh at memes, read fanfics and just have a lot of fun with this excellent Game. And I think I am going to replay Omori some time soon, playing another route (and also I wanted to say, this game is so good at being replayable, not only because of the alternative route, but because the story (again...) is sooo good and relatable, plus a lot of different things are in the game, that are hard to find through the first playthrough.)\n\nI felt so many different emotions, it was just a rollercoaster. It was so relatable in many ways. It hit right into my heart and made me cry even before the ending (at the end I bursted into tears). The way how the world and people change, how some people stop talking with you.\nMan, it feels so close to me. Especially at the time I am having right now, when it looks like the problems just fall on me from the nowhere and all my friends just try to deal with theirs, and so I lost contact with practically all people with whom I used to have so much fun back when I was just some naive kid, that did not know anything about the world...\nI could talk about Real Life segment for hours, but I am tired of writing, starting to lose my idea and I think that I kinda explained my feelings in my previous sentence. But I want to admit super cool thing about this game, that the characters are extremely relatable. Kel reminded me of my three several friends (sadly, I managed to keep the contact with only one of them, though now it very different, as he changed very much.) Aubrey also reminded of some my schoolmates (one of them is having practically identical situation as Aubrey had).\n\nAnd also my feelings after the game... To my surprise, I feel completely great and even better than before. As I see, many players are feeling depressed? I don’t know why I felt such way, maybe I kinda got used to acceptance of finishing games/mangas/films and ect. Or maybe because I felt that I had some kind of talk with some friend that I could have, that understands me and understand him... I feel so free and energetic, I don’t feel hollow and gloomy. This game Omori came to my life at the ideal moment when I needed help and support and I am so glad that I had this experience...\n\n(Sorry for such a long post, I've been having these thoughts for a long time and I could not explain and share them to anyone, so I finally decided just let my emotions do their thing and this happened. But still there are some things that I could talk about for hours and hours and this post would not end. I am grateful if you got this ending of my text, thank you!)",

I still remember my little shock when all the horror fun started to come  I mean first night, creepy atmosphere and also Hellmari with Something . Gosh, I am so excited  really sorry if my speech is becoming a mess, I am shivering because of my delightedness . Everything was so good and all elements of game  art,\nmusic, gameplay, story, characters and ect  made with love and soul. Though the game was rather long and had a lot of elements,\nOmori could entertain me for all my 25 hours  gameplay is really cool and very interesting, having a big variety of things , and even after this I am excited to watch gameplays of other people  I suggested my friend to play it and I watched and helped him with playing it  maybe I should did it, but he wasn’t against so...  , look and laugh at memes, read fanfics and just have a lot of fun with this excellent Game. And I think I am going to replay Omori some time soon, playing another route  and also I wanted to say, this game is so good at being replayable, not only because of the alternative route, but because the story  again...  is sooo good and relatable, plus a lot of different things are in the game, that are hard to find through the first playthrough. \n\nI felt so many different emotions, it was just a rollercoaster. It was so relatable in many ways. It hit right into my heart and made me cry even before the ending  at the end I bursted into tears . The way how the world and people change, how some people stop talking with you.\nMan, it feels so close to me. Especially at the time I am having right now, when it looks like the problems just fall on me from the nowhere and all my friends just try to deal with theirs, and so I lost contact with practically all people with whom I used to have so much fun back when I was just some naive kid, that did not know anything about the world...\nI could talk about Real Life segment for hours, but I am tired of writing, starting to lose my idea and I think that I kinda explained my feelings in my previous sentence. But I want to admit super cool thing about this game, that the characters are extremely relatable. Kel reminded me of my three several friends  sadly, I managed to keep the contact with only one of them, though now it very different, as he changed very much.  Aubrey also reminded of some my schoolmates  one of them is having practically identical situation as Aubrey had .\n\nAnd also my feelings after the game... To my surprise, I feel completely great and even better than before. As I see, many players are feeling depressed? I don’t know why I felt such way, maybe I kinda got used to acceptance of finishing games/mangas/films and ect. Or maybe because I felt that I had some kind of talk with some friend that I could have, that understands me and understand him... I feel so free and energetic, I don’t feel hollow and gloomy. This game Omori came to my life at the ideal moment when I needed help and support and I am so glad that I had this experience...\n\n Sorry for such a long post, I've been having these thoughts for a long time and I could not explain and share them to anyone, so I finally decided just let my emotions do their thing and this happened. But still there are some things that I could talk about for hours and hours and this post would not end.

   "body": "# THIS POST AND THE LISTED FANFICTIONS CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS FOR OMORI!\n\nWelcome to my list of the 20 best Omori fanfictions (plus 11 honorable mentions). This list aims to help both people who have never read an Omori fanfic and want a good place to start as well as avid readers looking for something new.\n\nWell actually, it's only 19 fanfictions. The 20th recommendation is an infamous fic by writer 'scitydreamer' published on the 23th of March 2021, which I can't talk about without the post getting removed ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nObviously, I haven't read every Omori fic in existence. I've only been reading these fics for six months, so I'm sure there's plenty of bangers I'm yet to read. If you know any spectacular fics, please share in them in the comments!\n\nI'm not a particularly good writer or critic, but i've tried my best to explain why I like each fanfiction. You'll have to take my word that all these fics are really, really good even if I can't quite find the words to explain why.\n\nThis list is unranked and written in no particular order.\n\n---\n\n### THE 20 BEST OMORI FANFICTIONS\nThe best of the best.\n\n---\n\n1. ### [Here Comes The Sun](https://archiveofourown.org/works/29558724/chapters/72642864) - MissNewGoomy (5dshadesofgay)\nIn Here Comes The Sun is a Sunflower-centric fanfiction in which Sunny and Mari move to Faraway town and meet the teenaged versions of Kel, Hero, Basil and Aubrey. The story focuses around a severely mentally ill Sunny who quickly becomes friends with an equally unwell Basil. This fic completely re-imagines the world of Omori and changes up enough stuff to basically be its own AU, all while featuring one of my favourite interpretations of Omori's character.\n\n1. ### [Lily Of The Valley](https://archiveofourown.org/works/33119203/chapters/82217893) - JohnJRenns\n For months I put off reading Lily of the Valley because it's premise sounded boring: 'What if Mari ACTUALLY committed suicide?' However, upon finally reading this fic I was blown away by the amount of mileage JohnJRenns was able get out of such simple premise. In exactly 85,022 words the author manages to detail Mari's gripping decent in depression and the fruitless struggles of her friends trying helplessly to save her. I went into the story knowing that Mari would die, but even despite this I was still floored when it finally happened. ON TOP OF THIS, Lily of the Valley also features an entire ten track album (of shockingly high quality music) composed for the story.\n\n1. ### [The House That Breathes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/33186568/chapters/82394128) - Shifting_Walls\nThe House That Breathes is what happens when you let Stephen King write an Omori Fanfic. Shortly after Sunny is saved from drowning in the lake, Something invades his home, inky flesh grows under the walls and floorboards, eyes stare from between cracks in the drywall, It's becoming more and more powerful with each passing moment... unless it's all just in Sunny's mind? This is a vile, horrifying tale in all the best ways, with Sunny's descent into insanity being brilliantly written. The House That Breathes is one of those fanfictions where after reading it you have to wonder why the author is wasting their time writing Omori fanfiction when they could be writing New York Times bestsellers instead.\n\n1. ### [Broken Space](https://archiveofourown.org/works/29971407/chapters/73783695) - SpoonusBoius\nFor fans of angst, this is Broken Space. At first, everything seems great, Mari doesn't die, the friend group never breaks up and everyone's happy, until characters start having strange dreams. Suddenly, we're induced to alternate timeline where everything went terribly and the consequences of this soon being to bleed into the real timeline. The clock is ticking, everything is bound to go wrong. This is a fanfiction as dark and brutal as it is spectacular and creative.\n\n1. ### [4 is Company, So is 5](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38077039) - prettypinklass\nThis is one of the few one-shots included on this list, but it's by far one of my favourites. 4 is Company, So is 5, is a short crossover between Left 4 Dead and Omori. After the events of the apocalypse, Sunny turns out to be one of the few immune to the Green Flu and ends up being adopted by the main cast of Left 4 Dead. For a story that takes place during the end of the world, it's shockingly wholesome... Watching Sunny slowly come out of his shell and be accepted into this found family of misfits is incredibly satisfying. Also, don't worry if you haven't played Left 4 Dead, the story will still make sense even if you don't know a thing about the game's plot.\n\n1. ### [The Garden of Bones](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30521553) - SheerSaxifrage\nThe Garden of Bones is as short but absolutely soul crushing. This fic focuses on each character coping after Kel is diagnosed with bone cancer, meanwhile Kel's own version of Headspace begins to deteriorate alongside his body. This fic is a short read, at only 23,000 words, you could easily find yourself accidently reading the whole thing in a single sitting, just as I did. The story is unforgivingly brutal and goes into Kel's cancer treatment and slow deterioration with sickening depth. An incredible read for anyone with a taste for a more morbid story.\n\n1. ### [The Pursuit AU (You're Back, Mari + I'll Find Him)](https://archiveofourown.org/series/2404663) - Otomerson\nThe Pursuit AU. You might have heard of it, as this fanfic has become infamous in the Omori fandom for being as excellently written as it is unapologetically disturbing. If you've ever heard people on the subreddit reference 'Pursuit Hero', this is where that comes from. Anyway, the fic is split into two parts, \"*You're Back, Mari*\" and \"*I'll Find Him*\". You're Back, Mari is in my opinion the weaker of the two, but is still a very good read. Basically the premise of the fic is that Hero goes insane after he saves Sunny from commiting suicide and slowly starts to succumb to psychotic delusions caused by the toll losing Mari put on his mind. You're Back, Mari features two endings, a good ending where Hero recovers from his madness and a bad ending where he does not. I'll Find Him is the second part and a continuation of the bad ending. Here, Hero completely succumbs to his madness, becoming a controlling narcissistic psychopath obsessed with 'protecting' Sunny and willing to kill anyone who tries to stop him. All in all, The Pursuit AU is easily one of the best Omori fanfics and a worthwhile read for any fan of the game.\n\n1. ### [Something Spectacular](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31452671) - witheredahlia\nNot much to say about this one. It's a short one-shot in which Basil and Mari have a conversation about the Incident after Sunny basically told Basil to piss off when he suggested hanging Mari. It's really, really, really, REALLY well written and also has a cool twist on Basil's character that I don't want to spoil.\n\n1. ### [Dread Hunt](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38468311/chapters/96142531) - ShardOfHope\nDread Hunt. My god how I love Dread Hunt. Infact, I'd go as far as calling Dread Hunt my all time favourite Omori fanfiction. I usually don't enjoy fanfictions that stray far from the source material, but Dread Hunt is an exception because you can tell how much thought, love and care the author has poured into this work. Anyway, Dread Hunt is a supernatural take on the world of Omori. After the events of the game's good ending, Sunny is attacked by his Something, which turns out to have been a demon that's spent the last four years feeding on his misery. Sunny fights it off and it escapes. Sunny then decides that the only reasonable course of action is to spend years training to become a professional monster hunter and then return to Faraway to kill Something once and for all. I cannot even begin to express how much I love this fic. Sunny is an complete badass in this story and it's such a refreshing and unique take on his character. This is easily one of the most FUN Omori fanfics. Every single chapter is so creative, well written and full of life. I love it.\n\n1. ### [they say, flowers are meant to be sunkissed](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31901416/chapters/78993871) - witheredahlia\nFor the based Sunflower enjoyers reading, I'd recommend this fic. It's easily one of the best Sunny x Basil fics out there. After the events of the good ending, Sunny disappears and doesn't contact Basil again, meanwhile Basil (who is very displeased about Sunny abandoning him again) grows to despise Sunny. This all comes to a head when they end up getting put in the same dorm room in college by shear insane luck. Chaos ensues. I've seen fair few Omori fics try their hand at 'angry Basil' but none of them do it as well as this fic. Basil's anger here feels real and justified and it's super satisfying watching Sunny and Basil slowly learn to love each other again. \n\n1. ### [One Month, One Shot](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43560927/chapters/109525026) - ShardOfHope\nOne Month, One Shot is one of the most unique fanfics on this list. Basically every month ShardOfHope writes a one-shot and adds it as a chapter on this fic. At the time of writing, there's currently 13. Anyway, these one-shots tend to very from 'pretty alright' to 'bloody brilliant' depending on which one you're reading. If you're wondering, my favourite one-shots are chapters 2, 4 and 7, so I'd recommend those if you want a taste of the fanfic.\n\n1. ### [The ocean washed open your grave.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/28802058) - murg\nThe Ocean Washed Open Your Grave is a near surgical breakdown of everything that makes up Hero's character. This fic is *THE* Hero character study. This fic is like a mechanic disassembling a car engine piece by piece to analyse it's flaws and then expertly reassembling the whole thing. The Ocean Washed Open Your Grave is a profound and intelligent one-shot filled to the brim with depth and emotion. It's also a reference to a Car Seat Headrest song. Anyway, if you're a Hero fan, you *will* enjoy this fic.\n\n1. ### [In Which Sunny Is Bad At Naming Things](https://archiveofourown.org/works/28865187/chapters/70808292) - Prince_Enby\nIn Which Sunny Is Bad At Naming Things is a very popular fanfic for a simple reason. It's fun. It's just a dumb, goofy chatfic that doesn't take itself very seriously. Read this if you want some lighthearted Sunny and friends shenanigans after reading some of the more depressing fics on this list.\n\n1. ### [The Sun in Another Solar System](https://archiveofourown.org/works/41042310/chapters/102866124) - TellThemNaegi\nThe Sun in Another Solar System a unique take on a post good ending story. Unfortunately, I read this fic a long time ago and I can't really remember the plot too well and I'd rather not re-read an entire 200,000 word fic just to write a short review, so I'm not going to go as in detail about the plot here as I did with the other fics. Anyway, this fic is a post good ending fic where Sunny starts a new life after his friends reacted poorly to the Truth. The story also introduces a bunch of really well written OCs that help make this story stand out in an ocean of mediocre post good ending fics. It's very good. It's got some cool twists. Worth a read.\n\n1. ### [Their Time](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31534616/chapters/78013100) - ShardOfHope\nThat right, it's another ShardOfHope fanfic. If you couldn't tell, I really, really like their work. After Sunny commits suicide, he's approached by Death who tells Sunny that he'll spare him from being sent to Hell on one condition. Sunny agrees and his spirit is sent forward in time to see the damage his death caused to his friend's lives. Sunny is tasked with fixing the damage he caused and saving his friends from following in his footsteps, with the punishment for failure being eternal damnation. As you can probably tell, this is a fic that is unapologetically angsty, which I personally enjoy, but might not be to everyone's taste.\n\n1. ### [Envelopes of Blood and Petals](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38631177) - prettypinklass\nFour years after Basil commits suicide, Polly finds a stack of letters addressed to his still grieving friends. This is a heartbreaking one-shot that I love. The fic is short and the quality speaks for itself, so I don't have much to say here.\n\n1. ### [A New Dawn In Sunless Skies](https://archiveofourown.org/works/40829928/chapters/104846292) - letos\nBasically, Sunny commits suicide after leaving Faraway but is reborn as a girl named Makoto with all his memories. Eventually, Makoto grows up and meets Sally, Kel's little sister. Face to face with her past life, Makoto struggles with wanting to keep her new life and wanting to learn what happened to Sunny's friends. A New Dawn In Sunless Skies is an exceptionally creative fic. The dynamic between Makoto and the still remaining fragments of Sunny's personality is incredibly well written.\n\n1. ### [Estranged](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31981264/chapters/79210135) - Kerbonaut\nAfter Mari falls down the stairs, Basil calls for help and saves her life. However, the rift this incident leaves between her and Sunny sends Mari spiraling into depression. This is a fic that I really feel captures of the spirit of the game in a way not many fanfictions do. It's also a really good Mari-centric fic for any Mari fans out there.\n\n1. ### [What Lies Beyond](https://archiveofourown.org/works/33709504/chapters/83783308) - AngelicBeast\nThis is a weird one. After dying, Sunny wakes up in another world and is rescued by a mysterious doctor. Sunny learns that his whole life was spent in a Matrix style simulation and now that he's dead, he's been sent to the real world. Sunny sets out to find Mari, knowing that she must be somewhere in this new world. Meanwhile, in the simulation, Basil confesses the truth of Mari's death to his friends and the weight of Sunny's death beings to set in. This is a brilliantly creative fanfic, taking inspiration from The Matrix to create a one of a kind Omori fic.\n\n1. ### ...\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n---\n\n### THE HONOURABLE MENTIONS\nFor fanfics that are great, but didn't make the top 20.\n\n---\n\n[Fallout and Future](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38489923/chapters/96198547) - ArchScreams\n\n\"*Basil woke up at the hospital to find Sunny confessing the truth to his friends. He hoped that it was over, that they could finally be happy again, but Sunny dropped off the face of the Earth. Now, it was up to Basil to handle the fallout and future. Forgiveness would come slower from some than others, and the road ahead was long, but it was there—and Basil wouldn't be alone this time. (A post-canon Basil-centric sunflower fic focused on a realistic depiction of the healing process, exploring the relationships within the friend group (mainly Basil's relationships).*\"\n\n[Sometimes Goodbye Is A Second Chance](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46065394/chapters/115958269) - Smitty1899\n\n\"*Like every good story, it started with a tragedy. After four years, Kel thought he could finally overcome his grief. Three days of rekindling friendships, fixing mistakes, and maybe, just maybe, moving on. As fate would have it, it wasn't meant to be. With nothing left, who could blame him for being desperate? Who could blame him for leaving? Succisa Virescit, Latin for the phrase \"that which gets cut down grows back stronger\". And even though Kel left... well, sometimes goodbye is a second chance. The only problem is that he doesn't know exactly what went wrong in the first place... and it can be a little hard adjusting to going from being seventeen to twelve in the blink of an eye. But that would be fine... right?*\"\n\n[How to Save Your Friends From Shitty Parents: a Questionable Guide by Hero](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38020657/chapters/94963483) - prettypinklass\n\n\"*Hero and Kel contemplate what to do about the shitty family situations of their friends. The answer may not be obvious at first... (Or, Hero being the dad friend joke goes a little too far. A series of short stories)*\"\n\n[The Difference Between a Villain and a Hero is Nothing but How They're Perceived](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38753133) - prettypinklass\n\n\"*Sunny is twenty one. His friends know the truth. He's still friends with them. Most of them, at least. He goes to college, he has a therapist, and he has a boyfriend that he loves more then anything in the world. Escaping the past isn't that simple though. Especially not when some people are still stuck in it.*\"\n\n[OMORI X SCP](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38753133) - ArsenoBarseno\n\n\"*OMORI characters have become SCP subjects. This is their official (not really) document pages.*\"\n\n[Sunny gets disowned and becomes a cryptid to avoid confronting his issues](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45158569/chapters/113601466) - TheCatIsBehindTheTelevision\n\n\"*Sunny told the truth. He finally achieved the freedom he so longed for. Unfortunately, his mom is bad at regulation and accidentally gave him too much freedom by promptly disowning him. Out of options, Sunny does the only thing he can think of and decides to become a cryptid to haunt Faraway Town.*\"\n\n[Martyrdom](https://archiveofourown.org/works/35228191/chapters/87785548) - Wayward_Fable\n\n\"*No one is perfect. A lesson that seems simple in nature, but one that Basil can never seem to learn. To believe such a thing exists is exactly the cause of their tragedy. For when Basil stumbles upon a confrontation between Sunny and Mari, he is lost and confused. It is only when he realizes that the blame must be cast that he comes up with a plan. To Basil, Sunny was perfect. Someone who's perfect does not deserve to take the blame. Who better to take it, then, than himself? (An AU where Basil takes the blame for Mari's death, rather than framing her death as a suicide.)*\"\n\n[Culinary Conversations](https://archiveofourown.org/works/33445063/chapters/83083204) - ShardOfHope\n\n\"*Sunny is trying his best, he really is. But his own overactive imagination continues to haunt him, even after the Omori was defeated. The road to recovery is long and hard, but for right now he just wants to finish cooking his fried rice. However, there is an imp in his kitchen telling him that life isn't worth living. What did he do to deserve this?*\"\n\n[The Faraway Suicides](https://archiveofourown.org/works/29974683) - SheerSaxifrage\n\n\"*No one could remember whose idea it was, or if there was ever a time before they knew they would eventually be killing themselves. Aubrey and Kel wanted to do it as soon as possible, all of them in the treehouse at once; but Hero forbid it, said the gate was only wide enough for one at a time. Mari agreed. They were the leaders, so that was that. (The gang agrees to die together.)*\"\n\n[That Tree Looks a Little Lonely; Let's Give It a Friend, Shall We?](https://archiveofourown.org/works/29393445/chapters/72209247) - Prince_Enby\n\n\"*Kel's trying his best. He's okay. Really! And even if he wasn't, that's okay, too, because he'll deal with it. He always does. No need to bother anyone with it - it'll be fine! Or, Kel learns how to paint, and maybe a few other things.*\"\n\n[OMORI: Dreamwork is Teamwork](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31523756/chapters/77984171) - EvidentlyIHaveNoLife, FmsDraws\n\n\"*The story is set one year before the in-game events. SUNNY's HEADSPACE Friends (including MARI) have come to the real world for an unknown reason. And it's not only he who can see them.*\"",

If you've ever heard people on the subreddit reference 'Pursuit Hero', this is where that comes from. Anyway, the fic is split into two parts, \"*You're Back, Mari*\" and \"*I'll Find Him*\". You're Back, Mari is in my opinion the weaker of the two, but is still a very good read. Basically the premise of the fic is that Hero goes insane after he saves Sunny from commiting suicide and slowly starts to succumb to psychotic delusions caused by the toll losing Mari put on his mind. You're Back, Mari features two endings, a good ending where Hero recovers from his madness and a bad ending where he does not. I'll Find Him is the second part and a continuation of the bad ending. Here, Hero completely succumbs to his madness, becoming a controlling narcissistic psychopath obsessed with 'protecting' Sunny and willing to kill anyone who tries to stop him. All in all, The Pursuit AU is easily one of the best Omori fanfics and a worthwhile read for any fan of the game.\n\n1. ###  Something Spectacular  https://archiveofourown.org/works/31452671  - witheredahlia\nNot much to say about this one. It's a short one-shot in which Basil and Mari have a conversation about the Incident after Sunny basically told Basil to piss off when he suggested hanging Mari. It's really, really, really, REALLY well written and also has a cool twist on Basil's character that I don't want to spoil.\n\n1. ###  Dread Hunt  https://archiveofourown.org/works/38468311/chapters/96142531  - ShardOfHope\nDread Hunt. My god how I love Dread Hunt. Infact, I'd go as far as calling Dread Hunt my all time favourite Omori fanfiction. I usually don't enjoy fanfictions that stray far from the source material, but Dread Hunt is an exception because you can tell how much thought, love and care the author has poured into this work. Anyway, Dread Hunt is a supernatural take on the world of Omori. After the events of the game's good ending, Sunny is attacked by his Something, which turns out to have been a demon that's spent the last four years feeding on his misery. Sunny fights it off and it escapes. Sunny then decides that the only reasonable course of action is to spend years training to become a professional monster hunter and then return to Faraway to kill Something once and for all. I cannot even begin to express how much I love this fic. Sunny is an complete badass in this story and it's such a refreshing and unique take on his character. This is easily one of the most FUN Omori fanfics. Every single chapter is so creative, well written and full of life. I love it.\n\n1. ###  they say, flowers are meant to be sunkissed  https://archiveofourown.org/works/31901416/chapters/78993871  - witheredahlia\nFor the based Sunflower enjoyers reading, I'd recommend this fic. It's easily one of the best Sunny x Basil fics out there. After the events of the good ending, Sunny disappears and doesn't contact Basil again, meanwhile Basil  who is very displeased about Sunny abandoning him again  grows to despise Sunny. This all comes to a head when they end up getting put in the same dorm room in college by shear insane luck. Chaos ensues. I've seen fair few Omori fics try their hand at 'angry Basil' but none of them do it as well as this fic. Basil's anger here feels real and justified and it's super satisfying watching Sunny and Basil slowly learn to love each other again. \n\n1. ###  One Month, One Shot  https://archiveofourown.org/works/43560927/chapters/109525026  - ShardOfHope\nOne Month, One Shot is one of the most unique fanfics on this list. Basically every month ShardOfHope writes a one-shot and adds it as a chapter on this fic. At the time of writing, there's currently 13. Anyway, these one-shots tend to very from 'pretty alright' to 'bloody brilliant' depending on which one you're reading. If you're wondering, my favourite one-shots are chapters 2, 4 and 7, so I'd recommend those if you want a taste of the fanfic.\n\n1. ###  The ocean washed open your grave.  https://archiveofourown.org/works/28802058  - murg\nThe Ocean Washed Open Your Grave is a near surgical breakdown of everything that makes up Hero's character. This fic is *THE* Hero character study. This fic is like a mechanic disassembling a car engine piece by piece to analyse it's flaws and then expertly reassembling the whole thing. The Ocean Washed Open Your Grave is a profound and intelligent one-shot filled to the brim with depth and emotion. It's also a reference to a Car Seat Headrest song. Anyway, if you're a Hero fan, you *will* enjoy this fic.\n\n1. ###  In Which Sunny Is Bad At Naming Things  https://archiveofourown.org/works/28865187/chapters/70808292  - Prince_Enby\nIn Which Sunny Is Bad At Naming Things is a very popular fanfic for a simple reason. It's fun. It's just a dumb, goofy chatfic that doesn't take itself very seriously. Read this if you want some lighthearted Sunny and friends shenanigans after reading some of the more depressing fics on this list.\n\n1. ###  The Sun in Another Solar System  https://archiveofourown.org/works/41042310/chapters/102866124  - TellThemNaegi\nThe Sun in Another Solar System a unique take on a post good ending story. Unfortunately, I read this fic a long time ago and I can't really remember the plot too well and I'd rather not re-read an entire 200,000 word fic just to write a short review, so I'm not going to go as in detail about the plot here as I did with the other fics. Anyway, this fic is a post good ending fic where Sunny starts a new life after his friends reacted poorly to the Truth. The story also introduces a bunch of really well written OCs that help make this story stand out in an ocean of mediocre post good ending fics. It's very good. It's got some cool twists. Worth a read.\n\n1. ###  Their Time  https://archiveofourown.org/works/31534616/chapters/78013100  - ShardOfHope\nThat right, it's another ShardOfHope fanfic. If you couldn't tell, I really, really like their work. After Sunny commits suicide, he's approached by Death who tells Sunny that he'll spare him from being sent to Hell on one condition. Sunny agrees and his spirit is sent forward in time to see the damage his death caused to his friend's lives. Sunny is tasked with fixing the damage he caused and saving his friends from following in his footsteps, with the punishment for failure being eternal damnation. As you can probably tell, this is a fic that is unapologetically angsty, which I personally enjoy, but might not be to everyone's taste.\n\n1. ###  Envelopes of Blood and Petals  https://archiveofourown.org/works/38631177  - prettypinklass\nFour years after Basil commits suicide, Polly finds a stack of letters addressed to his still grieving friends. This is a heartbreaking one-shot that I love. The fic is short and the quality speaks for itself, so I don't have much to say here.\n\n1. ###  A New Dawn In Sunless Skies  https://archiveofourown.org/works/40829928/chapters/104846292  - letos\nBasically, Sunny commits suicide after leaving Faraway but is reborn as a girl named Makoto with all his memories. Eventually, Makoto grows up and meets Sally, Kel's little sister. Face to face with her past life, Makoto struggles with wanting to keep her new life and wanting to learn what happened to Sunny's friends. A New Dawn In Sunless Skies is an exceptionally creative fic. The dynamic between Makoto and the still remaining fragments of Sunny's personality is incredibly well written.\n\n1. ###  Estranged  https://archiveofourown.org/works/31981264/chapters/79210135  - Kerbonaut\nAfter Mari falls down the stairs, Basil calls for help and saves her life. However, the rift this incident leaves between her and Sunny sends Mari spiraling into depression. This is a fic that I really feel captures of the spirit of the game in a way not many fanfictions do. It's also a really good Mari-centric fic for any Mari fans out there.\n\n1. ###  What Lies Beyond  https://archiveofourown.org/works/33709504/chapters/83783308  - AngelicBeast\nThis is a weird one. After dying, Sunny wakes up in another world and is rescued by a mysterious doctor. Sunny learns that his whole life was spent in a Matrix style simulation and now that he's dead, he's been sent to the real world. Sunny sets out to find Mari, knowing that she must be somewhere in this new world. Meanwhile, in the simulation, Basil confesses the truth of Mari's death to his friends and the weight of Sunny's death beings to set in. This is a brilliantly creative fanfic, taking inspiration from The Matrix to create a one of a kind Omori fic.\n\n1. ### ...\n¯\\_ ツ _/¯\n\n---\n\n### THE HONOURABLE MENTIONS\nFor fanfics that are great, but didn't make the top 20.\n\n---\n\n Fallout and Future  https://archiveofourown.org/works/38489923/chapters/96198547  - ArchScreams\n\n\"*Basil woke up at the hospital to find Sunny confessing the truth to his friends. He hoped that it was over, that they could finally be happy again, but Sunny dropped off the face of the Earth. Now, it was up to Basil to handle the fallout and future. Forgiveness would come slower from some than others, and the road ahead was long, but it was there—and Basil wouldn't be alone this time.  A post-canon Basil-centric sunflower fic focused on a realistic depiction of the healing process, exploring the relationships within the friend group  mainly Basil's relationships .*\"\n\n Sometimes Goodbye Is A Second Chance  https://archiveofourown.org/works/46065394/chapters/115958269  - Smitty1899\n\n\"*Like every good story, it started with a tragedy. After four years, Kel thought he could finally overcome his grief. Three days of rekindling friendships, fixing mistakes, and maybe, just maybe, moving on. As fate would have it, it wasn't meant to be. With nothing left, who could blame him for being desperate? Who could blame him for leaving? Succisa Virescit, Latin for the phrase \"that which gets cut down grows back stronger\". And even though Kel left... well, sometimes goodbye is a second chance. The only problem is that he doesn't know exactly what went wrong in the first place... and it can be a little hard adjusting to going from being seventeen to twelve in the blink of an eye. But that would be fine... right?*\"\n\n How to Save Your Friends From Shitty Parents: a Questionable Guide by Hero  https://archiveofourown.org/works/38020657/chapters/94963483  - prettypinklass\n\n\"*Hero and Kel contemplate what to do about the shitty family situations of their friends. The answer may not be obvious at first...  Or, Hero being the dad friend joke goes a little too far. A series of short stories *\"\n\n The Difference Between a Villain and a Hero is Nothing but How They're Perceived  https://archiveofourown.org/works/38753133  - prettypinklass\n\n\"*Sunny is twenty one. His friends know the truth. He's still friends with them. Most of them, at least. He goes to college, he has a therapist, and he has a boyfriend that he loves more then anything in the world. Escaping the past isn't that simple though. Especially not when some people are still stuck in it.*\"\n\n OMORI X SCP  https://archiveofourown.org/works/38753133  - ArsenoBarseno\n\n\"*OMORI characters have become SCP subjects. This is their official  not really  document pages.*\"\n\n Sunny gets disowned and becomes a cryptid to avoid confronting his issues  https://archiveofourown.org/works/45158569/chapters/113601466  - TheCatIsBehindTheTelevision\n\n\"*Sunny told the truth. He finally achieved the freedom he so longed for. Unfortunately, his mom is bad at regulation and accidentally gave him too much freedom by promptly disowning him. Out of options, Sunny does the only thing he can think of and decides to become a cryptid to haunt Faraway Town.*\"\n\n Martyrdom  https://archiveofourown.org/works/35228191/chapters/87785548  - Wayward_Fable\n\n\"*No one is perfect. A lesson that seems simple in nature, but one that Basil can never seem to learn. To believe such a thing exists is exactly the cause of their tragedy. For when Basil stumbles upon a confrontation between Sunny and Mari, he is lost and confused. It is only when he realizes that the blame must be cast that he comes up with a plan. To Basil, Sunny was perfect. Someone who's perfect does not deserve to take the blame. Who better to take it, then, than himself?  An AU where Basil takes the blame for Mari's death, rather than framing her death as a suicide. *\"\n\n Culinary Conversations  https://archiveofourown.org/works/33445063/chapters/83083204  - ShardOfHope\n\n\"*Sunny is trying his best, he really is. But his own overactive imagination continues to haunt him, even after the Omori was defeated. The road to recovery is long and hard, but for right now he just wants to finish cooking his fried rice. However, there is an imp in his kitchen telling him that life isn't worth living. What did he do to deserve this?*\"\n\n The Faraway Suicides  https://archiveofourown.org/works/29974683  - SheerSaxifrage\n\n\"*No one could remember whose idea it was, or if there was ever a time before they knew they would eventually be killing themselves. Aubrey and Kel wanted to do it as soon as possible, all of them in the treehouse at once; but Hero forbid it, said the gate was only wide enough for one at a time. Mari agreed. They were the leaders, so that was that.  The gang agrees to die together. *\"\n\n That Tree Looks a Little Lonely; Let's Give It a Friend, Shall We?  https://archiveofourown.org/works/29393445/chapters/72209247  - Prince_Enby\n\n\"*Kel's trying his best. He's okay. Really! And even if he wasn't, that's okay, too, because he'll deal with it. He always does. No need to bother anyone with it - it'll be fine! Or, Kel learns how to paint, and maybe a few other things.*\"\n\n OMORI: Dreamwork is Teamwork  https://archiveofourown.org/works/31523756/chapters/77984171  - EvidentlyIHaveNoLife, FmsDraws\n\n\"*The story is set one year before the in-game events. SUNNY's HEADSPACE Friends  including MARI  have come to the real world for an unknown reason. And it's not only he who can see them.*\" https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/1924bh1/my_20_favourite_omori_fanfiction_recommendations/",

Y’know, in hindsight, maybe chasing down Rosa and fighting the Download Window would’ve probably taken less time but, eh, whatever.\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/xeT9z0vH2xo)\n\n#”HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!!”\n\n“We’ve finally found you, Pluto!\n\n#THERE’S NO ESCAPE!”\n\nOh right, this is where we befriend Pluto.\n\n“Oh, no… My gigantic, well defined arms and legs are giving out.” Pluto says while panting, “I can’t let it end like this. I need to find a hiding place! Hey, yo-“\n\n“Hide in the hole.” I say as I point to the giant crater.\n\n“Sunny, that seems a little too obvious of a hiding spot.” Kel says in a somewhat confused tone.\n\n“Imma be completely honest, most of Headspace’s residents have the intelligence of the average parent from a crappy cartoon for children. Besides, Occam's Razor is a thing for a reason. Pluto will be fine.”\n\n“Thank you, small one.” Pluto says as he hops into the hole in the ground.\n\n“Here they come, guys.” Hero says.\n\nTwo Space Pirates come from the north exit, time to enact my genius plan.\n\n“Hey, you two! You’re looking for a buff planetoid, right?”\n\n^“Sunny, ^what ^the ^hell ^are ^you ^doing?”\n\n“Yes, actually, you know where he went?” One of the Pirates ask.\n\n“Yeah, he flew somewhere towards Snowglobe Mountain. You better get there soon, I heard he’s gonna head to Deeper Well afterwards, who knows, maybe he’s gonna try and find the secret of the Abyss or something.”\n\n“Drat! Capt- er, Space Boyfriend is the only one who knows how to pilot the ship. Thanks for the info, kid, hopefully we can find another way there.” The other says as the two leave.\n\n“Coast’s clear.” Kel says as he approaches the hole, to which Pluto responds by doing a flip out of said hole.\n\n#”GWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\n\nQuick thinking *and* clever deception! I must say, I’m more than impressed! You four have my eternal gratitude. What are your names, if you wish to tell me.”\n\n“I’m Henry Vicente, though everyone calls me Hero.”\n\n“Aubrergine Tristesse, call me Aubrey.”\n\n“The name’s Kelsey, though Kel rolls off the tongue better. I’m Hero’s brother.”\n\n“And I am Sunny Sora… I’m the only one here without a nickname.”\n\n“Wait… are you *the* Sunny Sora, the Dreamer?”\n\n“Y-yes…?”\n\n“My goodness!” Pluto says as he bows down, “I am so sorry for not treating with such respect, my Lord, please forgive me for our fight earlier.”\n\n“P-please don’t treat me like a god, Pluto, I don’t have any special powers or anything and I don’t exactly like being treated differently from others. I’m just your everyday Headspace resident now.” \n\n“Well, the least I can do for you is give the four of you lifetime free passes for my transportation company, considering you just ensured my freedom.”\n\n“You have one of those?” Aubrey asks.\n\n“I do now! Introducing Pluto’s Spaceline!\n\n#GWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!”\n\n“Pluto’s so friggin’ cool!” Kel shouts.\n\n“So where to, young ones?”\n\n“How about the campsite?” Hero says.\n\n“My first request, how exciting! Everyone, hop on!”\n\nI jump on Pluto’s head, Aubrey takes the right arm, Hero takes the left, and Kel clings onto Pluto’s leg cause there was no much room left.\n\n“Hold on for your lives everyone! Because we’re gonna be flying high!” I shout.\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/Xmpy9wddtcs)\n\nAnd we’re flying. Everyone but Pluto and I are terrified.\n\n“Landing in 5! 4! 3! 2! 1!”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/fYZg48_7zi4)\n\n#”GWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!”\n\nAnd here we are, the party is on the ground trying to regain their composure.\n\n“How was that for a smooth ride?”\n\n“Pretty good, pretty good, music was nice and the environment was chill. 10/10 if I do say so myself.” I say.\n\n“You’re insane!” Pretty much everyone else says.\n\n“You three all did great holding on for dear life, especially you Kelsey!” Pluto says with a beaming grin.\n\n“Oh, if you’re gonna teach him how to flex, he already knows.” I tell Pluto.\n\n“Oh, well, farewell, children. Until next time!”\n\n“Wait!”\n\n“Oh, Lor-, er, Sunny, do you need something?”\n\nI should at least do Sumireko a favor, even if she’s probably gonna work with the Stranger, I don’t think she’s a bad person, at least I don’t want to think she is, and it’d be wrong to inconvenience someone.\n\n“Pluto, if you meet a girl named Sumireko Usami, please give her group a free pass as well.”\n\n“An odd request, but very well. Until next time.”\n\nAnd there he goes again, keep on flying…\n\n^”Is ^he… ^saluting ^Pluto?”\n\n^”Don’t ^question ^it, ^Aubrey.”\n\nAlright time to face off with Space Boyfriend! We make our way up the-\n\n“Hey, Sunny, what’s that?” Hero asks.\n\n“A recycling machine, you can get clams and charms from this thing.”\n\n“Welp,” Hero says as he pulls out a giant bag from his hammerspace, “guess we’re gonna be here for a while.”\n\n“W-when did you-“\n\n“He was collecting that stuff while we were looking for the mixtape.” Aubrey says.\n\n“Recycling’s good for the environment and we get stuff, it’s a win-win.”\n\n“Great…”\n\n——\n\n**3 Minutes later**\n\n**You got Seer Glasses, Flashlight, Cellphone, Universal Remote, and 775 Clams!**\n\n“And that should be everything.”\n\n“Finally...”\n\nI’ll be taking the Universal Remote, given that I’m the all-rounder and an overall stat buff sounds nice.\n\n“Aubrey, take the Nokia.” I say as a toss it to her.\n\n“Hey, careful, you know these things can cave in heads.”\n\n“Yeah, whatever. Hero, goggles, catch.”\n\n“You know you can just hand them to us, right?” Hero says as he straps the thing to his face.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWe probably should buy items before facing off with Space Boyfriend now that I think about it.\n\nDown the hill we go and back to Mari’s picnic blanket, and there’s the mailbox.\n\n“Hero, take the lead, you get discounts.”\n\n“Alright…?”\n\nHero knocks on the Mailbox, waiting for a response.\n\n“Ah, if it isn’t Hero, my favorite and most handsome customer! Discounts for you, always! So… please buy something! ^Kekeke… “\n\n“Uhh… sure.” Hero says before turning to me, “What should we get first?”\n\n“Sell this.” I say as I hand him the “Gold” Watch, “It’s 500 extra clams in our pockets.”\n\n“Huh, alright.”\n\nHero puts the watch in the mailbox and waits patiently for the clams.\n\n“Hey, are you-“ Hero is cut off my a clam to the face, “ow, the he-“\n\n499 more clams fire out of the mailbox like a mini-gun letting loose bullets, completely enveloping Hero’s head.\n\n**HERO became toast.**\n\nAh shit, he died.\n\n*Pop*\n\n“S-so much fresh bread…”\n\nNever mind.\n\n^”Yozora, ^is ^that ^a ^normal ^occurrence ^in ^this ^realm?”\n\n^”Yep, ^I ^assume ^this ^isn’t ^too ^weird ^in ^comparison ^to ^stuff ^that ^happens ^in ^Gensokyo, ^Ran.”\n\n^”Correct, ^though ^this ^is ^very ^much ^more ^amusing.”\n\n“Thank you for your sale, now what do you wish to buy? ^Kekeke… ” the mailbox asks.\n\nMath time, oh boy… so we have around 2150 clams, with the available items being smores, cherry sodas, banana smoothies, rubber bands, sparklers, and jars of Life Jam which cost 60, 70, 70, 75, 100, and 300 respectively, with the discount in effect, that becomes, 54, 63, 63, 68 after rounding up, 90, and 270.\n\nEven if we are early into the progression of this sequence of dreams, banana smoothies recover too little Juice to justify a purchase, even if it effects the entire party, so cherry sodas will be our go-to’s for Juice recovery, though having a few on hand would be nice.\n\nLife Jam is a revive so there’s no reason not to get those, same goes with smores considering, aside from Hero, no one here has healing capabilities.\n\nWe’re gonna need those sparklers for Space Boyfriend, so those should be in our top 3 for stuff to get.\n\nLastly is the rubber bands, they’re good, but having an emotional advantage is much better than having a raw stat advantage.\n\n“Mari! Can you throw me some scratch paper and one of your pens?!”\n\n“Sure thing, lil’ bro!” Mari says as she tosses me the requested items.\n\nOkay so the equation should be 54m+63(c+b)+68r+90p+270j≤2150.\n\nRunning through most of the equations I can think of on the spot, I get the seemingly most optimal combination being 3 smores, 5 sodas, 2 smoothies, 1 rubber band, 8 sparklers, and 3 Life Jams, leaving us with only 17 clams left.\n\nI write down everything we need on the back of the paper and hand it to Hero, which he slides into the mailbox hesitantly.\n\n“Thanks for the business! ^Kekeke… “ the mailbox says as it dispenses all the requested items.\n\n“Alright, that should be just about everything, let’s get moving people.” I say.\n\n“Good luck everyone!” Mari shouts as tosses us some space food to recover our Heart and Juice. Finally, we make our way back up to Spaceboy’s house.\n\nRetracing our steps back to our final destination of this first quest, the door to our first real fight stands before us… ah, screw the purple prose and pondering, into the door we go!\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/khJG4IajHS4)\n\n“Okay, so how are we gonna get Spaceboy to stop being, uh, like that?” Kel asks.\n\n“Like this.” I say as I approach the boom box and insert the mixtape on its A-Side.\n\n“What in the name of the Dreamer are you doing?!” The Space Pirate that was watching over the space case here shouts at me.\n\n“Moving the plot along, now shut up and run before you get caught in the crossfire.” I say as I press play.\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/BhYAmu0bzf)\n\n^”Welp, ^I’m ^outta ^here.”\n\n“Bug Spray? Fuckin’ really?” Aubrey says.\n\n“Hey, it’s a nice song, and fitting considering the whole Spaceboy-Space Boyfriend situation we talked about earlier.” I reply.\n\n^”The ^what ^now?”\n\n“Yeah, but it’s so… painfully cheesy.”\n\n“You’re just saying that cause you have no concept of romance.” I say in the smuggest tone my voice can allow.\n\n“Says the guy that’s had no human interaction aside from his parents in four years.”\n\n“Jokes on-“\n\n“Will the two of you **SHUT UP ALREADY?!**” the Captain shouts as he rises, “I have to listen to this ungodly song while two idiotic teenagers bicker about nothing!”\n\n“Piss off.” “I just did algebra earlier, so I *can’t* be an idiot!”\n\n“Whatever, though I must say, thank you- one second.” Space Boyfriend warps to my position, “Could you get into your battle formation real quick? I, uh, need to make the music more appropriate for our showdown.”\n\n“Oh, sure, go right ahead.” I say as I move in front of the bed.\n\n**BGM Silence**\n\nSpace Boyfriend ejects the cassette from the boom box, flips it over the B-Side, and reinserts it.\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/Axlx_bY6uv8)\n\n“Better?”\n\n“Much better.” The entire party, myself included, respond. Look, I like the Bugspray, but it ain’t fitting for pre-battle dialog.\n\n“Now where was I? Oh, right, I must thank you for getting me out of that feeble state. Lying around like that is just so pathetic and boring. Feelings like those are for losers!”\n\nHero uncomfortably shuffles in place at that last comment.\n\n“Now that I’m finally free, that wench, Sweetheart, will pay for leaving me even after I gave her my everything!\n\n#EVERYTHING! YOU HEAR ME?!”\n\n“That is completely fair for feeling that way.” I say.\n\n“Sunny, I’m 90% sure he’s going to kill her.” Hero whispers to me.\n\n“And Sweetheart’s an egotistical bitch that makes everyone’s life in Headspace worse.”\n\n“See, the short, black haired boy agrees with me!  Now let me through so I can show her what for.” Space Boyfriend says as he prepares to make his exit.\n\n“Now hold it right there, insane you recolor of a plagiarism, I never said we’d let you go. Yes, blowing Sweetheart’s brains out might be a massive net positive for this world and as much as I’d want you to do it, but one murder is a slippery slope to you going more nuts than you already are. How about you sit down and calm down?”\n\n^”Spaceboy’s ^plagiarized?”\n\n“And of what authority are you to tell me what to do? You four are just children with no knowledge of what she’s put me through!”\n\n“Well, low and behold,” Kel says with a smug grin on his face, “the boy who agreed with your cause but not your to-be actions is your god, the one and only Dreamer! ^Also ^the ^other ^three ^of ^us ^come ^from ^his ^world, ^but ^you’ll ^probably ^only ^listen ^to ^Sunny. So you better listen to him or face divine judgement!”\n\n“The Dreamer, eh? Well, that changes everything… THIS WILL BE A GLORIOUS TEST OF MY SKILLS!! Come, Dreamer! Let us spar to decide the fate of she who has wronged me! Show me what a being from the Promised Land is truly capable of!” Space Boyfriend shouts as he draws his ray gun, aiming it in my direction.\n\n“Kel.”\n\n“Yeah, I know I screwed up.”\n\n“Okay.” I sigh and draw my knife and point it in his direction, “Challenge accept, Space Ex-Boyfriend, if my team and I win, you calm down and turn back into the Captain, if you win, we leave you to your own devices, got it?”\n\n“Very well, Dreamer, let the battle begin!”\n\nKel pulls out his Meteor Ball and begins dribbling it, Aubrey draws her Cosmic Hammer, and Hero puts his dukes up, let’s rock!\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/Ejpa-nzLvjI)\n\n“Alright, Sunny, what’s the strategy?” Hero shouts.\n\n“Alright, Space Ex-Boyfriend’s eventually gonna be stuck in the **Angry** emotion line, so we’re gonna need to stay in the **Happy** line as long as possible. Kel, use Encourage on yourself, Aubrey, bully Space Case, it’ll speed things along by just getting him mad now, Hero use a sparkler on yourself and I’ll do the same, Aubrey, follow our lead after you piss Spacey off.”\n\n“Right!” Everyone shouts.\n\n“Come on Kel, you got this!” Kel shouts to himself, a soft yellow glow enveloped him.\n\n**KEL feels Happy!**\n\nI pull out some sparklers and watch it shine. Cool. My sight gains a slight yellow tint.\n\n**SUNNY feels Happy!**\n\n“Hey Space Ex-Boyfriend!” Aubrey shouts.\n\n“What?!”\n\n“Maybe the reason Sweetheart dumped your sorry ass was because you couldn’t give her a good time!”\n\n“You-“\n\n**SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND feels Angry!**\n\n“You don’t have to go that hard on him.” I say.\n\n“Hey, it’s all or nothing in these sorts of situations.”\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend fires at Aubrey, likely for her kinda over the line mark.\n\nHero mimics what I did as ordered, that same yellow once again appearing.\n\n**HERO feels Happy!**\n\nRound 2 time!\n\n“I can win! I feel great! I-can-do-this!!” Kel practically screams as he pumps his hands into the air, the yellow glow becoming an aura.\n\n**KEL feels Ecstatic!**\n\nSecond verse, same as the first, one sparkler coming right up! The yellow tint becomes more like a filter over my vision.\n\n**SUNNY feels Ecstatic!**\n\nAubrey pulls out a sparkler and is somewhat mesmerized by it.\n\n**AUBREY feels Happy!**\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend runs up and attempts to kick me, though I dodge thanks to my increased speed.\n\nHero once again pulls out a sparkler, gaining that same aura as Kel.\n\n**HERO feels Ecstatic!**\n\n“Alright, chief, I guess it’s time for you, me, and Hero to go on the offensive now and Aubrey will join in next turn, yeah?” Kel says while jumping up and down in excitement.\n\n“One more turn for you, before that encourage me.”\n\n“Didn’t the self help book say that there were only two levels of emotion.”\n\n“Yeah, but remember when I mentioned certain people being able to use stage 3 emotions and I said I might be able to reach that point? How about we give it a whirl?”\n\n“Got it. Go for it Sunny! We believe in you!”\n\nA sudden burst in power flows through me, it worked! My sight becomes a sort of yellow-monochrome as my body starts twitching.\n\n**SUNNY feels Manic!**\n\n“**Now that’s what I’m talking about!**” I scream as I charge at Space Ex-Boyfriend and attempt to hack away, One strike hits to the heart, another misses, and he gets me stuck in a clash with his ray gun on the third strike.\n\n“No you don’t!” Hero shouts as he punches Space Ex-Boyfriend in the back of the head, breaking me free from the clash, allowing me to land the final slash.\n\n“Go get ‘em, Sunny!”\n\n“On it!” I say as I land yet another slash on Space Ex-Boyfriend.\n\nAubrey deploys the final sparkler for now.\n\n**AUBREY feels Ecstatic!**\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend wails at the top of lungs, it’s a bit painful, but not that bad thanks to emotional advantage.\n\nKel takes a deep breath and runs and guns Space Ex-Boyfriend with all his might, hitting straight to the heart!\n\n“My rage cannot be contained... You cannot placate me!”\n\nHere we go! Space Ex-Boyfriend can’t be anything but mad now.\n\nMy turn comes up, I point and laught at Space Ex-Boyfriend’s attempt to take us down, saying “So how’s your attempt at proving your strength to us Promise Landers?”\n\n“Shut it, Dreamer!” He shouts as he gets weaker like a chump.\n\n“Batter up!” Aubrey shouts as she takes a swing at Space Ex-Boyfriend worthy of sending a baseball out of the park, followed up by Hero hitting him with an uppercut.\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend looks wistfully into the distance, yep that’s about it.\n\nKel deploys a smoothie so we all recover a bit of Juice and I hack away.\n\nAubrey whacks Space Ex-Boyfriend and looks to Hero.\n\n“Don’t let your guard down!”\n\n“Whatever.”\n\nLittle does Aubrey know, her defense has been boosted.\n\nHero smiles at Space Ex-Boyfriend to weaken him more.\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend begins to sing an angsty song, but Kel quickly shuts him up by shooting a rubber band into his mouth before he can give one of us an emotional disadvantage, as well as lowering his defenses.\n\n“Gah! How are you still moving!?” Space Ex-Boyfriend snarls… followed up by him coughing up the rubber band.\n\n**SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND feels Enraged!**\n\nKel attacks and dunks with Hero, I hack away, Aubrey prepares to counter, and Hero tosses me a bandage.\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend fires at Kel, it doesn’t do much.\n\n“Hey, asshole! Hit me!” Aubrey shouts.\n\n“Why would I attack someone who’s telegraphing their counterattack?”\n\nKel and I crack open some sodas, Aubrey runs up and headbutts Space Ex-Boyfriend in the chin, and Hero punches him in the back of the head.\n\n“I... I won't let you defeat me! Tonight you will fall, **DREAMER!!!**” Space Ex-Boyfriend roars as he draws a card…?\n\n**SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND feels Furious!**\n\n“**Last Word! The Wrath of a Lonely Soul!**”\n\nNow, what should be happening is Spaceboy fires four shots that hit all four of us… what’s happening right now is actual bullet hell with hundreds of laser blasts with almost no way to avoid the attacks! \n\n“FIND COVER!” I shout.\n\nKel and I rush to the table and flip on its side to use as a shield and Aubrey and Hero do the same to the keyboard, taking a little as we were setting up the defenses.\n\n“Is this normal?!” Kel shouts due to the sound of Space Ex-Boyfriend’s blasts.\n\n“Not at all!” I respond in kind.\n\n“So what the fuck are we supposed to do?! We literally can’t dodge this and the bastard isn’t relenting!” Aubrey shouts from her side of the room.\n\nHero looks at how Space Ex-Boyfriend is firing and quickly comes to a realization. He turns to Kel and I and shouts, “There’s a pattern! If you start from the top of stairs, you can approach him in an S pattern and jump occasionally when the blasts come at your legs, you’ll reach him easily!”\n\nA-actually, yeah! That’s actually the case! I chow down on a smore, chug a soda, and start running to the stair well. I follow the pattern Hero mentioned and jump when the pattern calls for it, occasionally taking damage. Inch by inch, I gradually get closer and closer, until I jump at him, knife in hand.\n\n“WHAT?!” Space Ex-Boyfriend shout as he looks up at me.\n\n“So what were you saying about falling?” I say as I plunge my knife into him, “Because I feel like rising! Energy Release!”\n\nWe do the whole song and dance of our ultimate attack, finally bringing an end to this battle!\n\n“Ugh... My heart... It... hurts...”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/bucP7IAQ9Uo)\n\n“That… that was intense.” Kel pants.\n\n“Yeah, the hell was that all about?” Aubrey asks.\n\nI run over to Spaceboy’s collapsed body and pick up the card he pulled out. As I pick it up, I sorta recognize it, it’s probably from some residual memories from Doremy lingering in my head.\n\n**You got Space Boyfriend’s Spell Card!**\n\n>A card displaying a pattern of projectiles that Space Boyfriend used in his fight. Smells like tears.\n\n“It’s a spell card.” I say.\n\n“And those are…?” Hero asks.\n\n“Something from Gensokyo, I think. According to Doremy’s memories, I think this is how they fight. We’ll probably have to ask Yukari or Ran about this.”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/FCO9xUqCNlI)\n\n“Ow…” Spaceboy groans as he gets off the floor, “Wh-what happened and who are you?”\n\n“Space Boyfriend took over for a little bit and we had to beat the crap outta you to return you to normal.” I respond.\n\n“My goodness! I’m so sorry! Hopefully you four aren’t too hurt!”\n\n“We’re fine! Just got a few cuts and scrapes that some food should fix easily.” Kel says in an attempt to make him feel better.\n\n“Though that weird attack you used with that spell card probably would’ve killed us if Sunny didn’t immediately notice something was off.” Hero says in response to Kel’s comment.\n\n“Spell card…? Oh! You mean the card that blonde woman in that strange dress gave to me, right?” Spaceboy asks\n\nUh oh.\n\n“Did this woman you’re talking about have a mob cap with a ribbon or fox tails?” I ask.\n\n“Well, yes to that second one. She said that her mistress wanted to give it to me and wanted me to use it in when I’m close to being defeated.”\n\n“That woman… can we just beat the shit outta Yukari so we don’t have deal with her pull this kinda stuff.” Aubrey grumbles.\n\n“Wow, you’re, uh quite quick to violence miss… uh…”\n\n“You got a problem with that?”\n\n“N-not at all!” Spaceboy shouts as he runs over to his cabinet and grabs some stuff, “In fact, how about I give you these for a show of how okay I am with violence!?^P-please ^don’t ^hurt ^me. “  \n\n**You got Train Pass and Sno-Cone Ticket!**\n\n“Okay…?”\n\n“Sweet, now we can go to the Orange Oasis! ^Also ^a ^ticket ^for ^a ^free ^ultimate ^healing ^item. ” I say giddily\n\n“And that’s good because?”\n\n“We can get real strong and one of the best weapons for Kel can be obtained there if we’re lucky.”\n\n“Interesting.”\n\n“A-anyway,” Spaceboy says as he turns to me, “Your name is Sunny, like the Dreamer, no?”\n\n“Yep, I’m the Dreamer, yo- er, Space Boyfriend challenged us because he wanted to test his skills against us when he learned we were from the ‘Promised Land’. My friends here are Kel, Aubrey, and Hero.”\n\n“I am *truly* sorry my Lord-“\n\n“Don’t call me ‘my Lord’.”\n\n“Er- I am *truly* sorry… Sunny, I really should keep my emotions in control. Oh, and thank you for getting my mixtape back, it has all of Sweetheart and my favorite songs. It was nice to relive those memories.”\n\nTwo Pirates come running up the stairs.\n\n“Ah! Captain- er, Space Boyfr- no, wait, are you the Captain?” One asks.\n\n“Yes I am, don’t worry, Space Boyfriend is gone.”\n\n“Great! We’ve revived news that your favorite planet…oid has been spotted heading towards Snowglobe Mountain!” The first Pirate continues.\n\n“Please forgive us for losing track of him! We’ll-” The other says before being cut off.\n\n“It’s fine, if Pluto wants freedom, let him have it. He’s not gonna hurt anyone.” The Captain says as he stares into the sky above him.\n\n“Oh, and… uh, the power source the ship has vanished.” The first Pirate says under his breath.\n\n“H-how?”\n\n“We don’t know…“\n\n“Great… I’ll search for some batteries, maybe I can get some from dad. Oh, and Sunny, before you leave, know that we are indebted to your group, if you need anything, the Space Pirates will be at your beck and call!”\n\n“Alright, see you, Captain Spaceboy!” I say as I make my way down the stairs.\n\n^”B-but ^I ^wanted ^to…”\n\n^”You’ll ^get ^your ^chance ^next ^time, ^Kel.”\n\n^“I ^actually ^kinda ^wanted ^to ^talk ^with ^him ^more ^too…”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/I7xfgMTakqg)\n\n“Where to next?” Hero asks.\n\n“A farm house. We just gotta go there and we’ll be retuned to White Space. It’s to the west of the ladder we climbed to. Just follow the red foot-prints and we’ll be there in no time.” I reply.\n\n“Well, what’re we waiting for? Let’s get going.” Kel says as he makes a b-line to the exit.\n\nWe all follow in right behind him.\n\n“You’re a bitch, Yukari!” Aubrey shouts to and double birds Yukari as she runs through the campsite exit, noticing that she’s finally awake again.\n\n“And you are… uncivilized.” Yukari says in an attempt to make a comeback, but is still too tired to come up a better one.\n\n“Wait!” Mari shouts to me, “Sunny, how’s the search for your Basil going?”\n\n“Well, we’re not gonna find him on the surface of Headspace, we’re getting keys to B_ac_ \\__ace, where he really is.”\n\n“What’s… how did you say it.”\n\n“Don’t have the time to explain, gotta go! See you, Mari!” I say as I make my exit.\n\n^”Good ^luck, ^Sunny!”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/4HqIdYJidrk)\n\n“You again?” Aubrey says just out of view, “C’mon, say something.”\n\nThere’s the Stranger… and there goes the stranger into the field.\n\n“We can’t keep him waiting for us.” I say as I finally approached the rest of the group and regain my lead.\n\n“Yeah, I mean, he looks so much like Basil when we were kids… I wonder why you created him, Sunny, considering how antagonistic he is.” Kel ponders.\n\n“I don’t know why either…” I sigh.\n\nWe walk into the field.\n\n“Hey! Wait!” A tomboyish voice says before being cut off… I recognize that voice, that’s Renko.\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/sHjYspZqVqY)\n\nI turn back to see the way blacked off by a black void. Damnit! I just missed Sumireko’s group! If only I waited a few more seconds. Everyone sees the look on my face and they in turn begin to look concerned as to why I’m suddenly reacting negatively, I guess they just didn’t hear her.\n\n“Look, let’s just get going.” I sigh.\n\nI don’t want more people to be dragged into this mess and my one chance to final tell them not to dig deep into this world was just missed. I’m more pissed at myself if anything.\n\nWe travel through the field, following the Stranger, ignoring any diversions in the path… even… even if it may provide confort from the past, until we finally reach it the farm house… no point in waiting around. We follow the Stranger inside, despite the ominous red glow.\n\nHe stares at us before vanishing into the painting the large painting behind him.\n\nWe all look to each other, knowing what to do next. Without hesitation, we jump into the painting.\n\n**BGM Silence**\n\nWe arrive in a pitch black hallway, which we walk down to see the F key, a sheet music stand, a black lightbulb, and a family portrait that barely is recognizable to me anymore.\n\n**Bruuuum**\n\nA sheet appears on the stand. It’s notes are scribbled out.\n\n“Uh… h-hey Sunny? After Mari… what ever happened to your parents.” Aubrey asks nervously while looking at the portrait.\n\nI stiffen up a little before just letting it out.\n\n“D-Dad left, divorced mom, and has been off the radar since. A-and mom’s been distant towards me ever since.”\n\nHero and Aubrey look visibly shocked to hear that. Kel, clearly knowing what happened on with the whole thing regarding my dad at least, decides to take it upon himself to explain the rest, “Yeah, I’m not surprised either of you don’t know considering all that happened while you were in your deepest point of your depression Hero and you barely even come up to our block Aubrey. It… it was real bad, a lotta screaming in both English and Japanese Sunny’s mom was begging him to stay the entire time… and,” Kel sighs, “and I kinda picked up on Sunny’s parents not really liking him as much as Mari even back when we were kids. Sunny’s a good guy, but as much as I hate to say it, Mari was their star child given that she excelled in everything she did. Y-y’know what, I’ll stop talking now, I’m just making things worse.”\n\nHero and Aubrey just stand in silent shock at what was said, not only because of the content of the revolution, but how much it makes sense in retrospect.\n\nThat silence is interrupted by Something Behind Me appearing suddenly as the painting changed to black out the faces.\n\nI’m scared stiff and can’t move.\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/oQtmUKCNE74)\n\nIt catches me… and everyone else… and we reappear back in White Space.\n\n“J-just get it over with.” Hero says as he turns away, everyone else follows his lead and turns away from what’s coming next.\n\nIn… and out, well, here we go. I drive the knife into my stomach once.\n\n**SQUELCH**\n\n**BGM Silence**\n\nOmori, you better work with me this time, or else we’re both screwed.",

Y’know, in hindsight, maybe chasing down Rosa and fighting the Download Window would’ve probably taken less time but, eh, whatever.\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/xeT9z0vH2xo \n\n#”HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!!”\n\n“We’ve finally found you, Pluto!\n\n#THERE’S NO ESCAPE!”\n\nOh right, this is where we befriend Pluto.\n\n“Oh, no… My gigantic, well defined arms and legs are giving out.” Pluto says while panting, “I can’t let it end like this. I need to find a hiding place! Hey, yo-“\n\n“Hide in the hole.” I say as I point to the giant crater.\n\n“Sunny, that seems a little too obvious of a hiding spot.” Kel says in a somewhat confused tone.\n\n“Imma be completely honest, most of Headspace’s residents have the intelligence of the average parent from a crappy cartoon for children. Besides, Occam's Razor is a thing for a reason. Pluto will be fine.”\n\n“Thank you, small one.” Pluto says as he hops into the hole in the ground.\n\n“Here they come, guys.” Hero says.\n\nTwo Space Pirates come from the north exit, time to enact my genius plan.\n\n“Hey, you two! You’re looking for a buff planetoid, right?”\n\n^“Sunny, ^what ^the ^hell ^are ^you ^doing?”\n\n“Yes, actually, you know where he went?” One of the Pirates ask.\n\n“Yeah, he flew somewhere towards Snowglobe Mountain. You better get there soon, I heard he’s gonna head to Deeper Well afterwards, who knows, maybe he’s gonna try and find the secret of the Abyss or something.”\n\n“Drat! Capt- er, Space Boyfriend is the only one who knows how to pilot the ship. Thanks for the info, kid, hopefully we can find another way there.” The other says as the two leave.\n\n“Coast’s clear.” Kel says as he approaches the hole, to which Pluto responds by doing a flip out of said hole.\n\n#”GWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\n\nQuick thinking *and* clever deception! I must say, I’m more than impressed! You four have my eternal gratitude. What are your names, if you wish to tell me.”\n\n“I’m Henry Vicente, though everyone calls me Hero.”\n\n“Aubrergine Tristesse, call me Aubrey.”\n\n“The name’s Kelsey, though Kel rolls off the tongue better. I’m Hero’s brother.”\n\n“And I am Sunny Sora… I’m the only one here without a nickname.”\n\n“Wait… are you *the* Sunny Sora, the Dreamer?”\n\n“Y-yes…?”\n\n“My goodness!” Pluto says as he bows down, “I am so sorry for not treating with such respect, my Lord, please forgive me for our fight earlier.”\n\n“P-please don’t treat me like a god, Pluto, I don’t have any special powers or anything and I don’t exactly like being treated differently from others. I’m just your everyday Headspace resident now.” \n\n“Well, the least I can do for you is give the four of you lifetime free passes for my transportation company, considering you just ensured my freedom.”\n\n“You have one of those?” Aubrey asks.\n\n“I do now! Introducing Pluto’s Spaceline!\n\n#GWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!”\n\n“Pluto’s so friggin’ cool!” Kel shouts.\n\n“So where to, young ones?”\n\n“How about the campsite?” Hero says.\n\n“My first request, how exciting! Everyone, hop on!”\n\nI jump on Pluto’s head, Aubrey takes the right arm, Hero takes the left, and Kel clings onto Pluto’s leg cause there was no much room left.\n\n“Hold on for your lives everyone! Because we’re gonna be flying high!” I shout.\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/Xmpy9wddtcs \n\nAnd we’re flying. Everyone but Pluto and I are terrified.\n\n“Landing in 5! 4! 3! 2! 1!”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/fYZg48_7zi4 \n\n#”GWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!”\n\nAnd here we are, the party is on the ground trying to regain their composure.\n\n“How was that for a smooth ride?”\n\n“Pretty good, pretty good, music was nice and the environment was chill. 10/10 if I do say so myself.” I say.\n\n“You’re insane!” Pretty much everyone else says.\n\n“You three all did great holding on for dear life, especially you Kelsey!” Pluto says with a beaming grin.\n\n“Oh, if you’re gonna teach him how to flex, he already knows.” I tell Pluto.\n\n“Oh, well, farewell, children. Until next time!”\n\n“Wait!”\n\n“Oh, Lor-, er, Sunny, do you need something?”\n\nI should at least do Sumireko a favor, even if she’s probably gonna work with the Stranger, I don’t think she’s a bad person, at least I don’t want to think she is, and it’d be wrong to inconvenience someone.\n\n“Pluto, if you meet a girl named Sumireko Usami, please give her group a free pass as well.”\n\n“An odd request, but very well. Until next time.”\n\nAnd there he goes again, keep on flying…\n\n^”Is ^he… ^saluting ^Pluto?”\n\n^”Don’t ^question ^it, ^Aubrey.”\n\nAlright time to face off with Space Boyfriend! We make our way up the-\n\n“Hey, Sunny, what’s that?” Hero asks.\n\n“A recycling machine, you can get clams and charms from this thing.”\n\n“Welp,” Hero says as he pulls out a giant bag from his hammerspace, “guess we’re gonna be here for a while.”\n\n“W-when did you-“\n\n“He was collecting that stuff while we were looking for the mixtape.” Aubrey says.\n\n“Recycling’s good for the environment and we get stuff, it’s a win-win.”\n\n“Great…”\n\n——\n\n**3 Minutes later**\n\n**You got Seer Glasses, Flashlight, Cellphone, Universal Remote, and 775 Clams!**\n\n“And that should be everything.”\n\n“Finally...”\n\nI’ll be taking the Universal Remote, given that I’m the all-rounder and an overall stat buff sounds nice.\n\n“Aubrey, take the Nokia.” I say as a toss it to her.\n\n“Hey, careful, you know these things can cave in heads.”\n\n“Yeah, whatever. Hero, goggles, catch.”\n\n“You know you can just hand them to us, right?” Hero says as he straps the thing to his face.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWe probably should buy items before facing off with Space Boyfriend now that I think about it.\n\nDown the hill we go and back to Mari’s picnic blanket, and there’s the mailbox.\n\n“Hero, take the lead, you get discounts.”\n\n“Alright…?”\n\nHero knocks on the Mailbox, waiting for a response.\n\n“Ah, if it isn’t Hero, my favorite and most handsome customer! Discounts for you, always! So… please buy something! ^Kekeke… “\n\n“Uhh… sure.” Hero says before turning to me, “What should we get first?”\n\n“Sell this.” I say as I hand him the “Gold” Watch, “It’s 500 extra clams in our pockets.”\n\n“Huh, alright.”\n\nHero puts the watch in the mailbox and waits patiently for the clams.\n\n“Hey, are you-“ Hero is cut off my a clam to the face, “ow, the he-“\n\n499 more clams fire out of the mailbox like a mini-gun letting loose bullets, completely enveloping Hero’s head.\n\n**HERO became toast.**\n\nAh shit, he died.\n\n*Pop*\n\n“S-so much fresh bread…”\n\nNever mind.\n\n^”Yozora, ^is ^that ^a ^normal ^occurrence ^in ^this ^realm?”\n\n^”Yep, ^I ^assume ^this ^isn’t ^too ^weird ^in ^comparison ^to ^stuff ^that ^happens ^in ^Gensokyo, ^Ran.”\n\n^”Correct, ^though ^this ^is ^very ^much ^more ^amusing.”\n\n“Thank you for your sale, now what do you wish to buy? ^Kekeke… ” the mailbox asks.\n\nMath time, oh boy… so we have around 2150 clams, with the available items being smores, cherry sodas, banana smoothies, rubber bands, sparklers, and jars of Life Jam which cost 60, 70, 70, 75, 100, and 300 respectively, with the discount in effect, that becomes, 54, 63, 63, 68 after rounding up, 90, and 270.\n\nEven if we are early into the progression of this sequence of dreams, banana smoothies recover too little Juice to justify a purchase, even if it effects the entire party, so cherry sodas will be our go-to’s for Juice recovery, though having a few on hand would be nice.\n\nLife Jam is a revive so there’s no reason not to get those, same goes with smores considering, aside from Hero, no one here has healing capabilities.\n\nWe’re gonna need those sparklers for Space Boyfriend, so those should be in our top 3 for stuff to get.\n\nLastly is the rubber bands, they’re good, but having an emotional advantage is much better than having a raw stat advantage.\n\n“Mari! Can you throw me some scratch paper and one of your pens?!”\n\n“Sure thing, lil’ bro!” Mari says as she tosses me the requested items.\n\nOkay so the equation should be 54m+63 c+b +68r+90p+270j≤2150.\n\nRunning through most of the equations I can think of on the spot, I get the seemingly most optimal combination being 3 smores, 5 sodas, 2 smoothies, 1 rubber band, 8 sparklers, and 3 Life Jams, leaving us with only 17 clams left.\n\nI write down everything we need on the back of the paper and hand it to Hero, which he slides into the mailbox hesitantly.\n\n“Thanks for the business! ^Kekeke… “ the mailbox says as it dispenses all the requested items.\n\n“Alright, that should be just about everything, let’s get moving people.” I say.\n\n“Good luck everyone!” Mari shouts as tosses us some space food to recover our Heart and Juice. Finally, we make our way back up to Spaceboy’s house.\n\nRetracing our steps back to our final destination of this first quest, the door to our first real fight stands before us… ah, screw the purple prose and pondering, into the door we go!\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/khJG4IajHS4 \n\n“Okay, so how are we gonna get Spaceboy to stop being, uh, like that?” Kel asks.\n\n“Like this.” I say as I approach the boom box and insert the mixtape on its A-Side.\n\n“What in the name of the Dreamer are you doing?!” The Space Pirate that was watching over the space case here shouts at me.\n\n“Moving the plot along, now shut up and run before you get caught in the crossfire.” I say as I press play.\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/BhYAmu0bzf \n\n^”Welp, ^I’m ^outta ^here.”\n\n“Bug Spray? Fuckin’ really?” Aubrey says.\n\n“Hey, it’s a nice song, and fitting considering the whole Spaceboy-Space Boyfriend situation we talked about earlier.” I reply.\n\n^”The ^what ^now?”\n\n“Yeah, but it’s so… painfully cheesy.”\n\n“You’re just saying that cause you have no concept of romance.” I say in the smuggest tone my voice can allow.\n\n“Says the guy that’s had no human interaction aside from his parents in four years.”\n\n“Jokes on-“\n\n“Will the two of you **SHUT UP ALREADY?!**” the Captain shouts as he rises, “I have to listen to this ungodly song while two idiotic teenagers bicker about nothing!”\n\n“Piss off.” “I just did algebra earlier, so I *can’t* be an idiot!”\n\n“Whatever, though I must say, thank you- one second.” Space Boyfriend warps to my position, “Could you get into your battle formation real quick? I, uh, need to make the music more appropriate for our showdown.”\n\n“Oh, sure, go right ahead.” I say as I move in front of the bed.\n\n**BGM Silence**\n\nSpace Boyfriend ejects the cassette from the boom box, flips it over the B-Side, and reinserts it.\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/Axlx_bY6uv8 \n\n“Better?”\n\n“Much better.” The entire party, myself included, respond. Look, I like the Bugspray, but it ain’t fitting for pre-battle dialog.\n\n“Now where was I? Oh, right, I must thank you for getting me out of that feeble state. Lying around like that is just so pathetic and boring. Feelings like those are for losers!”\n\nHero uncomfortably shuffles in place at that last comment.\n\n“Now that I’m finally free, that wench, Sweetheart, will pay for leaving me even after I gave her my everything!\n\n#EVERYTHING! YOU HEAR ME?!”\n\n“That is completely fair for feeling that way.” I say.\n\n“Sunny, I’m 90% sure he’s going to kill her.” Hero whispers to me.\n\n“And Sweetheart’s an egotistical bitch that makes everyone’s life in Headspace worse.”\n\n“See, the short, black haired boy agrees with me!  Now let me through so I can show her what for.” Space Boyfriend says as he prepares to make his exit.\n\n“Now hold it right there, insane you recolor of a plagiarism, I never said we’d let you go. Yes, blowing Sweetheart’s brains out might be a massive net positive for this world and as much as I’d want you to do it, but one murder is a slippery slope to you going more nuts than you already are. How about you sit down and calm down?”\n\n^”Spaceboy’s ^plagiarized?”\n\n“And of what authority are you to tell me what to do? You four are just children with no knowledge of what she’s put me through!”\n\n“Well, low and behold,” Kel says with a smug grin on his face, “the boy who agreed with your cause but not your to-be actions is your god, the one and only Dreamer! ^Also ^the ^other ^three ^of ^us ^come ^from ^his ^world, ^but ^you’ll ^probably ^only ^listen ^to ^Sunny. So you better listen to him or face divine judgement!”\n\n“The Dreamer, eh? Well, that changes everything… THIS WILL BE A GLORIOUS TEST OF MY SKILLS!! Come, Dreamer! Let us spar to decide the fate of she who has wronged me! Show me what a being from the Promised Land is truly capable of!” Space Boyfriend shouts as he draws his ray gun, aiming it in my direction.\n\n“Kel.”\n\n“Yeah, I know I screwed up.”\n\n“Okay.” I sigh and draw my knife and point it in his direction, “Challenge accept, Space Ex-Boyfriend, if my team and I win, you calm down and turn back into the Captain, if you win, we leave you to your own devices, got it?”\n\n“Very well, Dreamer, let the battle begin!”\n\nKel pulls out his Meteor Ball and begins dribbling it, Aubrey draws her Cosmic Hammer, and Hero puts his dukes up, let’s rock!\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/Ejpa-nzLvjI \n\n“Alright, Sunny, what’s the strategy?” Hero shouts.\n\n“Alright, Space Ex-Boyfriend’s eventually gonna be stuck in the **Angry** emotion line, so we’re gonna need to stay in the **Happy** line as long as possible. Kel, use Encourage on yourself, Aubrey, bully Space Case, it’ll speed things along by just getting him mad now, Hero use a sparkler on yourself and I’ll do the same, Aubrey, follow our lead after you piss Spacey off.”\n\n“Right!” Everyone shouts.\n\n“Come on Kel, you got this!” Kel shouts to himself, a soft yellow glow enveloped him.\n\n**KEL feels Happy!**\n\nI pull out some sparklers and watch it shine. Cool. My sight gains a slight yellow tint.\n\n**SUNNY feels Happy!**\n\n“Hey Space Ex-Boyfriend!” Aubrey shouts.\n\n“What?!”\n\n“Maybe the reason Sweetheart dumped your sorry ass was because you couldn’t give her a good time!”\n\n“You-“\n\n**SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND feels Angry!**\n\n“You don’t have to go that hard on him.” I say.\n\n“Hey, it’s all or nothing in these sorts of situations.”\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend fires at Aubrey, likely for her kinda over the line mark.\n\nHero mimics what I did as ordered, that same yellow once again appearing.\n\n**HERO feels Happy!**\n\nRound 2 time!\n\n“I can win! I feel great! I-can-do-this!!” Kel practically screams as he pumps his hands into the air, the yellow glow becoming an aura.\n\n**KEL feels Ecstatic!**\n\nSecond verse, same as the first, one sparkler coming right up! The yellow tint becomes more like a filter over my vision.\n\n**SUNNY feels Ecstatic!**\n\nAubrey pulls out a sparkler and is somewhat mesmerized by it.\n\n**AUBREY feels Happy!**\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend runs up and attempts to kick me, though I dodge thanks to my increased speed.\n\nHero once again pulls out a sparkler, gaining that same aura as Kel.\n\n**HERO feels Ecstatic!**\n\n“Alright, chief, I guess it’s time for you, me, and Hero to go on the offensive now and Aubrey will join in next turn, yeah?” Kel says while jumping up and down in excitement.\n\n“One more turn for you, before that encourage me.”\n\n“Didn’t the self help book say that there were only two levels of emotion.”\n\n“Yeah, but remember when I mentioned certain people being able to use stage 3 emotions and I said I might be able to reach that point? How about we give it a whirl?”\n\n“Got it. Go for it Sunny! We believe in you!”\n\nA sudden burst in power flows through me, it worked! My sight becomes a sort of yellow-monochrome as my body starts twitching.\n\n**SUNNY feels Manic!**\n\n“**Now that’s what I’m talking about!**” I scream as I charge at Space Ex-Boyfriend and attempt to hack away, One strike hits to the heart, another misses, and he gets me stuck in a clash with his ray gun on the third strike.\n\n“No you don’t!” Hero shouts as he punches Space Ex-Boyfriend in the back of the head, breaking me free from the clash, allowing me to land the final slash.\n\n“Go get ‘em, Sunny!”\n\n“On it!” I say as I land yet another slash on Space Ex-Boyfriend.\n\nAubrey deploys the final sparkler for now.\n\n**AUBREY feels Ecstatic!**\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend wails at the top of lungs, it’s a bit painful, but not that bad thanks to emotional advantage.\n\nKel takes a deep breath and runs and guns Space Ex-Boyfriend with all his might, hitting straight to the heart!\n\n“My rage cannot be contained... You cannot placate me!”\n\nHere we go! Space Ex-Boyfriend can’t be anything but mad now.\n\nMy turn comes up, I point and laught at Space Ex-Boyfriend’s attempt to take us down, saying “So how’s your attempt at proving your strength to us Promise Landers?”\n\n“Shut it, Dreamer!” He shouts as he gets weaker like a chump.\n\n“Batter up!” Aubrey shouts as she takes a swing at Space Ex-Boyfriend worthy of sending a baseball out of the park, followed up by Hero hitting him with an uppercut.\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend looks wistfully into the distance, yep that’s about it.\n\nKel deploys a smoothie so we all recover a bit of Juice and I hack away.\n\nAubrey whacks Space Ex-Boyfriend and looks to Hero.\n\n“Don’t let your guard down!”\n\n“Whatever.”\n\nLittle does Aubrey know, her defense has been boosted.\n\nHero smiles at Space Ex-Boyfriend to weaken him more.\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend begins to sing an angsty song, but Kel quickly shuts him up by shooting a rubber band into his mouth before he can give one of us an emotional disadvantage, as well as lowering his defenses.\n\n“Gah! How are you still moving!?” Space Ex-Boyfriend snarls… followed up by him coughing up the rubber band.\n\n**SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND feels Enraged!**\n\nKel attacks and dunks with Hero, I hack away, Aubrey prepares to counter, and Hero tosses me a bandage.\n\nSpace Ex-Boyfriend fires at Kel, it doesn’t do much.\n\n“Hey, asshole! Hit me!” Aubrey shouts.\n\n“Why would I attack someone who’s telegraphing their counterattack?”\n\nKel and I crack open some sodas, Aubrey runs up and headbutts Space Ex-Boyfriend in the chin, and Hero punches him in the back of the head.\n\n“I... I won't let you defeat me! Tonight you will fall, **DREAMER!!!**” Space Ex-Boyfriend roars as he draws a card…?\n\n**SPACE EX-BOYFRIEND feels Furious!**\n\n“**Last Word! The Wrath of a Lonely Soul!**”\n\nNow, what should be happening is Spaceboy fires four shots that hit all four of us… what’s happening right now is actual bullet hell with hundreds of laser blasts with almost no way to avoid the attacks! \n\n“FIND COVER!” I shout.\n\nKel and I rush to the table and flip on its side to use as a shield and Aubrey and Hero do the same to the keyboard, taking a little as we were setting up the defenses.\n\n“Is this normal?!” Kel shouts due to the sound of Space Ex-Boyfriend’s blasts.\n\n“Not at all!” I respond in kind.\n\n“So what the fuck are we supposed to do?! We literally can’t dodge this and the bastard isn’t relenting!” Aubrey shouts from her side of the room.\n\nHero looks at how Space Ex-Boyfriend is firing and quickly comes to a realization. He turns to Kel and I and shouts, “There’s a pattern! If you start from the top of stairs, you can approach him in an S pattern and jump occasionally when the blasts come at your legs, you’ll reach him easily!”\n\nA-actually, yeah! That’s actually the case! I chow down on a smore, chug a soda, and start running to the stair well. I follow the pattern Hero mentioned and jump when the pattern calls for it, occasionally taking damage. Inch by inch, I gradually get closer and closer, until I jump at him, knife in hand.\n\n“WHAT?!” Space Ex-Boyfriend shout as he looks up at me.\n\n“So what were you saying about falling?” I say as I plunge my knife into him, “Because I feel like rising! Energy Release!”\n\nWe do the whole song and dance of our ultimate attack, finally bringing an end to this battle!\n\n“Ugh... My heart... It... hurts...”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/bucP7IAQ9Uo \n\n“That… that was intense.” Kel pants.\n\n“Yeah, the hell was that all about?” Aubrey asks.\n\nI run over to Spaceboy’s collapsed body and pick up the card he pulled out. As I pick it up, I sorta recognize it, it’s probably from some residual memories from Doremy lingering in my head.\n\n**You got Space Boyfriend’s Spell Card!**\n\n>A card displaying a pattern of projectiles that Space Boyfriend used in his fight. Smells like tears.\n\n“It’s a spell card.” I say.\n\n“And those are…?” Hero asks.\n\n“Something from Gensokyo, I think. According to Doremy’s memories, I think this is how they fight. We’ll probably have to ask Yukari or Ran about this.”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/FCO9xUqCNlI \n\n“Ow…” Spaceboy groans as he gets off the floor, “Wh-what happened and who are you?”\n\n“Space Boyfriend took over for a little bit and we had to beat the crap outta you to return you to normal.” I respond.\n\n“My goodness! I’m so sorry! Hopefully you four aren’t too hurt!”\n\n“We’re fine! Just got a few cuts and scrapes that some food should fix easily.” Kel says in an attempt to make him feel better.\n\n“Though that weird attack you used with that spell card probably would’ve killed us if Sunny didn’t immediately notice something was off.” Hero says in response to Kel’s comment.\n\n“Spell card…? Oh! You mean the card that blonde woman in that strange dress gave to me, right?” Spaceboy asks\n\nUh oh.\n\n“Did this woman you’re talking about have a mob cap with a ribbon or fox tails?” I ask.\n\n“Well, yes to that second one. She said that her mistress wanted to give it to me and wanted me to use it in when I’m close to being defeated.”\n\n“That woman… can we just beat the shit outta Yukari so we don’t have deal with her pull this kinda stuff.” Aubrey grumbles.\n\n“Wow, you’re, uh quite quick to violence miss… uh…”\n\n“You got a problem with that?”\n\n“N-not at all!” Spaceboy shouts as he runs over to his cabinet and grabs some stuff, “In fact, how about I give you these for a show of how okay I am with violence!?^P-please ^don’t ^hurt ^me. “  \n\n**You got Train Pass and Sno-Cone Ticket!**\n\n“Okay…?”\n\n“Sweet, now we can go to the Orange Oasis! ^Also ^a ^ticket ^for ^a ^free ^ultimate ^healing ^item. ” I say giddily\n\n“And that’s good because?”\n\n“We can get real strong and one of the best weapons for Kel can be obtained there if we’re lucky.”\n\n“Interesting.”\n\n“A-anyway,” Spaceboy says as he turns to me, “Your name is Sunny, like the Dreamer, no?”\n\n“Yep, I’m the Dreamer, yo- er, Space Boyfriend challenged us because he wanted to test his skills against us when he learned we were from the ‘Promised Land’. My friends here are Kel, Aubrey, and Hero.”\n\n“I am *truly* sorry my Lord-“\n\n“Don’t call me ‘my Lord’.”\n\n“Er- I am *truly* sorry… Sunny, I really should keep my emotions in control. Oh, and thank you for getting my mixtape back, it has all of Sweetheart and my favorite songs. It was nice to relive those memories.”\n\nTwo Pirates come running up the stairs.\n\n“Ah! Captain- er, Space Boyfr- no, wait, are you the Captain?” One asks.\n\n“Yes I am, don’t worry, Space Boyfriend is gone.”\n\n“Great! We’ve revived news that your favorite planet…oid has been spotted heading towards Snowglobe Mountain!” The first Pirate continues.\n\n“Please forgive us for losing track of him! We’ll-” The other says before being cut off.\n\n“It’s fine, if Pluto wants freedom, let him have it. He’s not gonna hurt anyone.” The Captain says as he stares into the sky above him.\n\n“Oh, and… uh, the power source the ship has vanished.” The first Pirate says under his breath.\n\n“H-how?”\n\n“We don’t know…“\n\n“Great… I’ll search for some batteries, maybe I can get some from dad. Oh, and Sunny, before you leave, know that we are indebted to your group, if you need anything, the Space Pirates will be at your beck and call!”\n\n“Alright, see you, Captain Spaceboy!” I say as I make my way down the stairs.\n\n^”B-but ^I ^wanted ^to…”\n\n^”You’ll ^get ^your ^chance ^next ^time, ^Kel.”\n\n^“I ^actually ^kinda ^wanted ^to ^talk ^with ^him ^more ^too…”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/I7xfgMTakqg \n\n“Where to next?” Hero asks.\n\n“A farm house. We just gotta go there and we’ll be retuned to White Space. It’s to the west of the ladder we climbed to. Just follow the red foot-prints and we’ll be there in no time.” I reply.\n\n“Well, what’re we waiting for? Let’s get going.” Kel says as he makes a b-line to the exit.\n\nWe all follow in right behind him.\n\n“You’re a bitch, Yukari!” Aubrey shouts to and double birds Yukari as she runs through the campsite exit, noticing that she’s finally awake again.\n\n“And you are… uncivilized.” Yukari says in an attempt to make a comeback, but is still too tired to come up a better one.\n\n“Wait!” Mari shouts to me, “Sunny, how’s the search for your Basil going?”\n\n“Well, we’re not gonna find him on the surface of Headspace, we’re getting keys to B_ac_ \\__ace, where he really is.”\n\n“What’s… how did you say it.”\n\n“Don’t have the time to explain, gotta go! See you, Mari!” I say as I make my exit.\n\n^”Good ^luck, ^Sunny!”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/4HqIdYJidrk \n\n“You again?” Aubrey says just out of view, “C’mon, say something.”\n\nThere’s the Stranger… and there goes the stranger into the field.\n\n“We can’t keep him waiting for us.” I say as I finally approached the rest of the group and regain my lead.\n\n“Yeah, I mean, he looks so much like Basil when we were kids… I wonder why you created him, Sunny, considering how antagonistic he is.” Kel ponders.\n\n“I don’t know why either…” I sigh.\n\nWe walk into the field.\n\n“Hey! Wait!” A tomboyish voice says before being cut off… I recognize that voice, that’s Renko.\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/sHjYspZqVqY \n\nI turn back to see the way blacked off by a black void. Damnit! I just missed Sumireko’s group! If only I waited a few more seconds. Everyone sees the look on my face and they in turn begin to look concerned as to why I’m suddenly reacting negatively, I guess they just didn’t hear her.\n\n“Look, let’s just get going.” I sigh.\n\nI don’t want more people to be dragged into this mess and my one chance to final tell them not to dig deep into this world was just missed. I’m more pissed at myself if anything.\n\nWe travel through the field, following the Stranger, ignoring any diversions in the path… even… even if it may provide confort from the past, until we finally reach it the farm house… no point in waiting around. We follow the Stranger inside, despite the ominous red glow.\n\nHe stares at us before vanishing into the painting the large painting behind him.\n\nWe all look to each other, knowing what to do next. Without hesitation, we jump into the painting.\n\n**BGM Silence**\n\nWe arrive in a pitch black hallway, which we walk down to see the F key, a sheet music stand, a black lightbulb, and a family portrait that barely is recognizable to me anymore.\n\n**Bruuuum**\n\nA sheet appears on the stand. It’s notes are scribbled out.\n\n“Uh… h-hey Sunny? After Mari… what ever happened to your parents.” Aubrey asks nervously while looking at the portrait.\n\nI stiffen up a little before just letting it out.\n\n“D-Dad left, divorced mom, and has been off the radar since. A-and mom’s been distant towards me ever since.”\n\nHero and Aubrey look visibly shocked to hear that. Kel, clearly knowing what happened on with the whole thing regarding my dad at least, decides to take it upon himself to explain the rest, “Yeah, I’m not surprised either of you don’t know considering all that happened while you were in your deepest point of your depression Hero and you barely even come up to our block Aubrey. It… it was real bad, a lotta screaming in both English and Japanese Sunny’s mom was begging him to stay the entire time… and,” Kel sighs, “and I kinda picked up on Sunny’s parents not really liking him as much as Mari even back when we were kids. Sunny’s a good guy, but as much as I hate to say it, Mari was their star child given that she excelled in everything she did. Y-y’know what, I’ll stop talking now, I’m just making things worse.”\n\nHero and Aubrey just stand in silent shock at what was said, not only because of the content of the revolution, but how much it makes sense in retrospect.\n\nThat silence is interrupted by Something Behind Me appearing suddenly as the painting changed to black out the faces.\n\nI’m scared stiff and can’t move.\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/oQtmUKCNE74 \n\nIt catches me… and everyone else… and we reappear back in White Space.\n\n“J-just get it over with.” Hero says as he turns away, everyone else follows his lead and turns away from what’s coming next.\n\nIn… and out, well, here we go. I drive the knife into my stomach once.\n\n**SQUELCH**\n\n**BGM Silence**\n\nOmori, you better work with me this time, or else we’re both screwed. https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/sbuznr/omori_x_touhou_the_border_between_dream_and/",

Sunny is being haunted by Mari’s ghost, Hero knows, Slice of Life Fic, yadda yadda yadda. This is the Sunny birthday special that was meant to be posted yesterday but I got sidetracked with other things.\n\n#Chapter 4: Happy Birthday Sunny! Let’s Hit Up The Arcade!\n\n——\n\n**Faraway but Nearby**\n\nPhotographsynthesis: So, does everyone have their money for the bus fare?\n\nBallin’Kel: Ye\n\nDr.ChefChip: Yep, yep. :)\n\nEggplanted_Bat: Yeah.\n\nPhotographsynthesis: Great! :D Now all that’s left is to wait until tomorrow and we’re all set!\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: whatre you guy talking about\n\nEggplanted_Bat: Your birthday, you dork. We’re coming over. Did you forget it’s in two days?\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: uh\n\nPhotographsynthesis: S-Sunny, did you actually forget? ~_~\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: no\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: yes\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: mom and i arent prepared for guests at the moment could you just save this for another time\n\nBallin’Kel: Nop\n\nBallin’Kel: Al r schedz r ony opn 4 te nex few daz n we cnt resched @ th@ pont\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: well bring your own stuff to sleep on cause we don’t have time to prepare for 4 people coming over\n\nEggplanted_Bat: How on earth are you able to decider that?!\n\nDr.ChefChip: Sure, we can probably throw together makeshift beds with some blankets and pillows like when Kel and I stayed at your place before you moved. :)\n\nEggplanted_Bat: Dibs on the couch.\n\nBallin’Kel: boo\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: so i cant talk you guys out of this\n\nEggplanted_Bat: Nope\n\nBallin’Kel: n\n\nDr.ChefChip: You’ll be stuck with us for a few days whether you like it or not. ;P\n\nPhotographsynthesis: You better start getting excited!!! >u<\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: alright alright\n\n**Direct Messages: Overcoming_Tulip —> Dr.ChefCook**\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: this is a terrible idea hero\n\nDr.ChefChip: Come on Sunny, it’s gonna be fine. :)\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: no no its not\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: all that trauma is gonna hit everyone again like a freight train the mari\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: dont you remember how you reacted when you saw her \n\nDr.ChefChip: I know we’ve talked about this constantly, but look, in reality we have no idea how they’ll react they see her. All we can do is hope this goes well.\n\nDr.ChefChip: Besides, everyone wants to see you in real life again. :D\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: fine\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: just\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: just dont expect that thingsll be hunky dory when they see her\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: capiche\n\nDr.ChefChip: Okay, okay. Chill.\n\nDr.ChefChip: Have more faith in your friends. :/\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: yeah\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: sorry, anxiety and unfounded worries and all that\n\n——\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/o6vbUHCtkJo)\n\n“Great…” I mumble and lean back into my chair, “This is just peachy.”\n\n“Ah, Sunny, what’s wrong?” Mari said floating down from the above apartment.\n\n“What were you- whatever, everyone’s coming over for a few days.” I say as I swivel around to face Mari.\n\n“Right, your 16th birthday’s coming up! …But that doesn’t answer my question.”\n\n“I guess I’m just anxious about everyone else seeing you again. I know I’ve talked to both you and Hero about it over the past few weeks, hell, it’s probably been the exact same conversation word for word a few times, but it’s just eating away at me.”\n\nMari softly sighs and puts her hands on my shoulders, causing a soft, cold feeling to spread across the top 1/8 of my body, “I’m sure everything’s going to be okay, so don’t worry.”\n\n“The last time someone told me, ‘everything’s going to be okay’, I lost an eye, so don’t exactly believe in that statement very much.”\n\n“You *really* shouldn’t be such a cynic about this Sunny.”\n\n“…Kay.”\n\n“Good, now let’s get prepared!” Mari exclaims as… she floats back to the above apartment. What on earth is she doing up there?\n\n“Well? Are you not scared of what will happen when they meet?”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/YIBtPYyEaRE)\n\nOh you gotta be… you know what, screw it! I’m not gonna deal with this tank top and boxer-wearing dick that’s just reclining on my bed!\n\n“Piss off, Omori, I’m already dealing with a bit of a crisis. Could you save this till next week or something?”\n\n“Unfortunately for you Sunny, I will not ‘piss off', as I am your depression, suicidal thoughts, etcetera, etcetera. You can not exactly get rid of me so easily. I also do not exactly appreciate being thought of as a ‘tank top and boxer wearing dick’.” Omori said while twirling a knife in my face to taunt me.\n\nOh god, he’s speaking in purple prose now… also he can read my mind, but eh, that’s to be expected considering he’s part of me.\n\n“Look, could you just leave me alone for a bit? I don’t need the physical embodiment of my mental illness bug-“\n\n“Sunny?” Mari said with her head peering through the above floor, “Who are you talking to?”\n\nOkay, seems like Mari can’t see Omori, noted.\n\n“Just thinking aloud, sis, sorry if I’m worrying you.”\n\nMari sighs and goes back to whatever the hell she was doing in the upstairs apartment.\n\n“Fine, I will leave you be for now. Just know that I am always watching.” Omori said as he slowly fades.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, whatever asshole.”\n\n^“Oh, ^kill ^yourself ^Patch ^the ^Pirate.”\n\n“Oh, now you talk like a normal person?!”\n\nOh yeah, I don’t think I’ve mentioned this cause, you know, I was just dealing with him, but Omori’s been pestering me for the past few weeks after he revealed himself when Hero came over. I’m not really afraid of him anymore cause at this point he’s just a mild nuisance, like a middle schooler trying, and failing, to harass a college student. He’s not doing enough to actually cause me mental distress, but enough to annoy me. Anyway, I gotta prepare for everyone coming over.\n\n——\n\n**The Next Day**\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/DO-lltf8W_4)\n\nToday’s the big day and, goddamn, have I been dreading it. Everyone mentioned they’d be here by 8:45 PM and it’s 8:44, just one more minutes and-\n\n*Beeeeeeep*\n\n“Heya Sunny, it’s Basil! Everyone’s here an-“\n\n“Hi Sunny! Sally’s doing well if you’re wondering.”\n\n“Kel, please let me finish before speaking up. Anyway, everyone’s here and getting their stuff out of the bus, so if you can, could you and your mom help us carry everything in if you can?”\n\n^”Look, ^the ^bat’s ^just ^for ^show, ^sir. ^I’m ^not ^gonna ^hit ^anyone ^with ^it. ^Give ^me ^a ^hammer ^and ^I’ll ^rip ^the ^nails ^right ^now ^if ^it ^makes ^you ^feel ^comfortable.”\n\n^”Aubrey, ^just, ^why ^did ^you ^bring ^your ^bat ^with ^you?”\n\n^”I ^bring ^it ^everywhere, ^Hero, ^no ^exceptions.”\n\n^”Even ^to ^school?!”\n\n^”…Yes.”\n\n“Uhh, yeah, could you get over here before Aubrey starts a fistfight with the bus driver? I-I’d rather not have her get arrested for assault… this would be incredibly awkward if I input the wrong code.”\n\n*Bzzt*\n\nAh crap. Okay, okay, you can do this Sunny, just let everyone in and deal with the whole Mari thing later.\n\n“Everyone’s here, mom, I’ll be right back.”\n\n“Alright honey, make sure you help them bring their stuff in if you can.”\n\nOkay, grab the spare keys for the gate door in case I accidentally lock myself out, head out the door, and-\n\n“Oh boy, I can’t wait to see everyone again!”\n\nGuess I’m dealing with *this* a lot sooner than later… goddamnit!\n\nIn a hushed tone, so mom doesn’t hear me seemingly talking to myself, I say to Mari, “Please, I am begging you here, save this until later. I’m not sure how Kel, Basil, and Aubrey are gonna react to seeing you, especially after nearly six hours of travel.”\n\n“Sorry Sunny, but I’ve been waiting for this for so long, I’m not taking no for an answer.” Mari said before rushing ahead to the front gate. Oh, I absolutely hate everything right now.\n\nAlright, out the door I go and to the front gate I head. I swear to god Mari ends up traumatizing them again, I’m gonna… uh, I can’t think of a facetious threat. Whatever, not the point, I’m close to the gate, I see Mari trying to talk to everyone who just arrived, Kel, Aubrey, and Basil are trying not to freak out… fuck. On the bright side, Hero at least looks pretty happy.\n\n“Uh… hey guys! Look, Hero and I will explain in the morning, I know this is certainly… bizarre too, uh, you know. Just don’t worry about it for now.”\n\nBasil barely holding it together, stammers “B-but, sh-she should b-b-b-be-“\n\nI put a single finger to my lip to single him to stop talking, there are more people than just us here and I’d rather not cause a scene. On that note, Hero turns to the rest of the group and says, “Come on guys, let’s get everything inside. We’ve got a big day tomorrow and we need rest.”\n\n——\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/xbvRW3n5-aQ)\n\n**The Next Day… again**\n\n“…and that’s everything that you need to know.” \n\nEveryone sits in stunned silence as Hero, Mari, and I finish explaining the whole ghost situation. Luckily, mom had just left for work around two hours before we started so we didn’t have to deal with her thinking we were completely insane.\n\n“Normally I’d think the three of you were insane, but I’m actually talking to a goddamn ghost.” Aubrey said while rubbing her temples, “I have no idea how to feel…”\n\nMari puts her hand on her chin inquisitively, “But I already showed myself to you, so it shouldn’t be that much of a surprise.”\n\nHold on, what? Now everyone’s taken aback, Basil being the first to ask, “What do you mean?!”\n\nRealization dawns on Aubrey, “You… you’re talking about that dream I had on the night of Sunny and Basil’s fight. You were begging me to wake up cause you knew they’d die if we didn’t call an ambulance soon.”\n\n“Ding, ding, ding! That’s right! And it’s a good thing that you listened to me, given that you were the first to find them.” Mari said with a wide smile.\n\nRight, Mari can enter dreams, so that makes sense.\n\nMari turns to Kel with a smug look to ask, “So what does Mr. ghost hunter think of my existence?~”\n\n“What in the world are- …Hero told you about my horror phase, didn’t he?” Kel said, slowly shrinking into his seat due to embarrassment.\n\n“Yep, yep.”\n\n“Don’t remind me, that was a very embarrassing time in my life...”\n\n“Hehe, I’m probably gonna tease you for that for the rest of your life.”\n\nWhile it kinda seems like everyone’s slowly getting accustomed to the whole ghost thing, Basil seems kinda uncomfortable about the whole thing. Mari takes note of this.\n\n“Hey Basil, what’s wrong?”\n\n“It-it’s, uh, it’s just… I’m, uh, it’s-“\n\nOh, I get what he wants to say, but Basil’s just a tad bit too afraid to say it, so I might as well say for him.\n\n“Basil’s afraid that you hate him for helping me cover up how you were killed.”\n\n“S-Sunny!”\n\nMari is taken aback, but also understanding given the circumstances and tries to reassure him by saying, “Basil, it’s fine… but I’m not really in the position to be affected by what you did, given that I was already dead.”\n\n“O-oh, but you have to at least think that what I did was absolutely horrible and-“\n\nMari lets out a sigh and says, “It was, it was something that was truly horrid, but doing something terrible doesn’t make you a bad person. It’s more than clear that you hate what you did and you want to grow from it. I don’t want to hold anything against you.”\n\n“Oh! Well, uh, th-thanks Mari.”\n\nHuh, guess Hero was right. Speaking of Hero, he clanks a glass he has with a fork to get everyone’s attention, “Now that we’ve got the full group truly together again, I think there’s something important we have to do.”\n\nEveryone nods and gather to the front of where I’m standing, they clear their throats and in unison say,\n\n#”Happy Birthday, Sunny!”\n\n“Oh, uh… thanks, guys.”\n\nRight, I’m turning 16 today, huh, it’s kinda strange, especially considering that my dead sister is *also* celebrating with me.\n\n“And since it’s your big day, you get to choose where we hang out today.” Kel said as a joking punched me on the arm.\n\n“Hmm, how about the arcade down the street, maybe I can get back to kicking all your asses in Guilty Gear.” I say with a cocky grin, Hobbeez and Gino’s always switched out arcade machines every three or four months and I always tended to gravitate towards fighting games. I’d like to think I was fairly okay at them, Tekken 3 was fairly fun but not my best, King of Fighters 97 was okay but not really my cup of tea, Killer Instinct was a lot of fun with all the ultra combos, but Guilty Gear was my main fighting game. It’s kinda jank and unbalanced in multiple areas,  but something about how the characters played just clicked with me, *especially* Dr. Baldhead.\n\n“Okay, smart ass, I’ll take you up on that. We’re still 1-1 after you got pissed off during our Street Fighter II match.” Aubrey said with the smuggest look possible.\n\n“That was the Rainbow Edition bootleg and you know that doesn’t count!”\n\n“Sure, sure, whatever you sore loser.”\n\nWe laugh it off, grab some of the money and head out to the arcade… I  honestly don’t know what they have there, so this’ll be an interesting new experience.\n\n——\n\n**5 minutes later**\n\n[BGM](https://youtu.be/aTfDtUFiquY)\n\nAh, the arcade, all sorts of sound full the air that almost entirely makes the music near impossible to hear, be it the sounds from the games being played or the excited cheers of a small crowd of people nearby playing what looks to be a new version of Street Fighter III; the last time I left my home, the latest version of that game was Second Impact, so I guess I missed out on whatever new content was added to it. We got our quarters, now where in the world is Guilty Gear? Ah, maybe the guy at the counter should be able to point me in the right direction.\n\n^”Oh ^hey, ^the ^Konami ^Simpsons ^Beat ^‘em ^Up! ^Basil, ^come ^on, ^we ^gotta ^play ^that ^thing ^again ^Basil!”\n\n^“Gah, ^Kel, ^h-hold ^on ^a ^sec!”\n\n^“Oh ^hey, ^Pac-Man ^Jr., ^man ^I ^loved ^playing ^that ^as ^a ^kid. ^Mari, ^wanna ^check ^it ^out?”\n\n^“Sure, ^sure, ^maybe ^you ^can ^show ^me ^some ^of ^your ^sick ^skills~”\n\n“Hey, excuse me, sir, do you have a Guilty Gear cabinet here?”\n\n“If you’re talking about the first game, then no.”\n\n“Wait, ‘first’? There were sequels?!”\n\n“Woah, calm down buddy, but yeah, there were two sequels. The latest version of the second sequel came out a while in Japan and my boss’ friend who lives there actually got it exported here recently. We did have to modify the thing so it accepts quarters but I’m not 100% sure it won’t just eat them occasionally. It’s near the back, it’s called Guilty Gear X2 #Reload. Also if you’re playing with someone, don’t play as I-No, the woman with the witch hat and guitar. She’s the boss character and has caused at least five fistfights.”\n\n“Gotcha, thanks, sir!”\n\nI back head over where Aubrey is to tell her.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, you don’t have to tell me, I heard you and the clerk talking about it. It’s a new game, it’s in the back, don’t play as Ee No or whatever her name is, right? Well, let’s get going.”\n\nAs we walk through the arcade, I see a vast array of games both new to me and some that I remember. Marvel Vs Capcom 2, Donkey Kong 3, Mega Man: The Power Battle, Final Fight, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, Tekken Tag Tournament, Dance Dance Revolution, and so many more.\n\n “Ah, there it is! You ready to get beat, Ms. ‘Best Ky in Faraway’?”\n\n“Oh, shut up Baldy.”\n\n“If anything, I’m less like Baldhead and more like Baiken.”\n\n“Baiken?”\n\n“Baiken, the secret boss from the original Guilty Gear. I accidentally ended up fighting her, when You, Basil, Kel, and I when we tried to go through the single-player as Sol… and lost. She lost an eye, is Japanese, ^has ^an ^affinity ^for ^sharp ^objects- “\n\n“Stop fantasizing and put your quarters in the machine. ^’Affinity ^for ^sharp ^objects’? ^Sunny, ^are ^you ^okay? “ Aubrey said as she rested her bat on the side of this glorious, giant hunk of metal.\n\nWe insert 2 quarters each into the cabinet, each causing a loud but short jingle to play. \n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/zN50auhrsAw)\n\nFinally, we reach the characters roster, man there are so many new faces, let’s see… Oh hey, Justice and Baiken’re playable now, neat! Aside from them, there’s this scantily clad blue-haired angle girl, a young nun, a guy with glasses and a bandana, and a robotic version of Ky are a few of the stand-out newcomers, but there is one notable absence.\n\n“Where’s Baldhead?” I say with the most disappointed look I could give, causing Aubrey to chuckle.\n\n“Well, looks you gotta find a new main. At least *I* still got Ky.”\n\n“That’s cause Ky’s essentially the Ken of Guilty Gear, excluding him would just be like Arc System Works pulled a Mortal Kombat 3. …I’ll go with this guy with the bag on his head, he looks like the type of weird character I usually play.”\n\nOnce I actually select the bag guy, whose name is Faust, I notice something, he has the same suit and giant scalpel that Baldhead had, guess he’s using a new name.\n\n“*What was that about finding a new main?*”\n\n“Oh shut up and choose your character.”\n\n“Okay, okay.”\n\nWe select our characters, choose a stage, and start the match.\n\n[**BGM (Note: Only let it play till 1:26:50)**](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V9khT_IUXUk&amp;amp;t=5196s)\n\n“Hopefully you haven’t gotten too rusty, birthday boy.”\n\n“Same goes to you, Ms. Punk.”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/mt3UWNYVDDI)\n\nBoth Faust and Ky do their into animations as Ky’s theme starts playing. Even though Baldhead/Faust is my main, I always thought Ky’s theme was the best out of the first game’s soundtrack, and this new remix is even better.\n\n“Heh, looks like the game *wants* me to win if it’s blasting my character’s theme.”\n\n“Don’t get too cocky yet, we just started.”\n\nI’ll spare you the details of the fight and get back to you after we’re done. (Author’s Note: Or from the writer’s perspective, I haven’t played #Reload, I’ve only played AC+R and I’m not sure how much the flow of battle differs between the two and I’m not don’t know how to write an interesting fight(ing game) scene without visuals, so, uh, just imagine the fight went something like [this](https://youtu.be/SjnyMxCgbY0) but at a smoother frame rate and actual game audio.)\n\n——\n\n**2 minutes later**\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/72X305iMLwc)\n\n“Wow, I really *am* rusty, huh.”\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/aTfDtUFiquY)\n\n“Good game, Sunny, you really gave me a run for my money.” Aubrey said while extending her arm for a handshake.\n\n“Yeah, good game to you too.” I say as I do the same.\n\n“Now that we finally settled that SF2 thing, *you* owe *me* a favor like you said you would when we made that bet a few years ago.”\n\n“You actually remember that bet? Yeesh, talk about holding onto something.”\n\n“Oh be quiet you, we still gotta lotta time before we should head back to your place, let’s keep playing.”\n\n——\n\n**6 Hours Later**\n\n[**BGM**](https://youtu.be/DO-lltf8W_4)\n\nNot much else really happened of note in the arcade, a lot of the time was just us focusing on whatever games any combination of the group with little actual discussion. Mari was also mostly being a cheerleader to the people she was around while playing the game. After getting home, using the shower, and switching into our night clothes, we had dinner, which was some really juicy steak prepared by my mom, and began eating the cake Hero made in preparation, which was a mix of Chocolate and Vanilla, with the batter apparently having cinnamon sugar mixed into it and various berries and some mochi being toppers. It’s great to see Hero’s getting back into cooking as a hobby at least. Also as a side note, apparently Aubrey’s hair dye isn’t as strong as she thought it was because the top half of her hair lost its pink hue, showing her almost completely bleached blonde hair from the top of her head to a bit below her neck and the two front strands being tipped with pink.\n\nOh right, presents! Kel and Hero got me, and by extension, Mari, sheet music from the old grand piano that arrived a few days ago. It was mostly some classics and obscure stuff we didn’t have back when Mari and I played piano, like Clair de Lune and Ilyinsky - Noure et Anitra, Op. 13: No. 7, Berceuse Harrison Sheckler being standouts. Aubrey made a custom pinwheel that has six propellers, each being a different color, those being blue, orange, green, pink, purple, and white. Lastly, Basil gave me the set of Vandas he was growing a few weeks ago. There were also cards from the people that we helped out back in Faraway, most of which were well-wishes with about $5-$25 included in each. While it was very much low-key, I honestly really enjoyed my time with everyone today. \n\nMom decided to call it a night so it’s just the six of us in the dining room discussing our plans for tomorrow.\n\n“So, we’ll be hitting the beach tomorrow?” I say with a mouth full of cake.\n\n“Yep! Hope you have some sunscreen and trunks.” Basil said after swallowing fork’s worth of cake.\n\n“Hmm, that might be a bit of a problem for me at least…”\n\n“What did you outgrow them? I’ll let you borrow mine from when I was fifteen.” Kel said jokingly.\n\n“First off, gross. Second, no, it’s not that, most of my old clothes still fit me. It’s that I don’t want anything irritating my eye socket cause I’m going back to the hospital to get my glass eye. The doctor said not to let anything happen  to it or else it might cause complications with it getting installed.” I say as I cut my piece of cake with my fork.\n\n“I mean, you could just not swim and just chill on the shore.”\n\n“That’s sho- Mari? Y-you know you physically can’t eat, right?”\n\nMari’s trying to gnaw at my fork to get a taste of Hero’s cake.\n\n“H-hey, I just wanna taste Hero’s food after so long. And the good news is that I think I can finally taste stuff, that sweet and rich chocolate and vanilla enhanced by the cinnamon is to die! Just a little longer and I’ll master this ghostly form of mine.” Mari said as she was beaming with joy.\n\n“That’s great! Anyway, back on topic, just relaxing in the sandy area should be fine, but what if I get a face full of sand.”\n\n“You have an eyepatch, I doubt anything is getting through there, you’re just being paranoid for no reason.” Aubrey said as she put her plate in the dishwasher.\n\n“I- yeah, true.”\n\nHero yawned as he finished his cup of tea he brewed for himself, “Guy, it’s getting late. Can we just hit the hay and worry about this tomorrow?”\n\nI glance over to the clock and realize that it’s nearly 11. Wow, we, uh, we really lost track of time.\n\n“Eh, yeah, sounds good, night, guys.” Aubrey said as she retreated to the couch.\n\n“Yeah, should get some rest.” Basil says as exhaustion starts to wash over him.\n\n“The party doesn’t truly end until we get back home, so let’s kick back and relax until tomorrow!” Kel shouts.\n\n^”Kel! ^Shut ^the ^hell ^up ^before ^I ^bash ^your ^skull ^in! ^I’m ^trying ^to ^sleep!”\n\n“Sorry!”\n\n——\n\n**2 Hours Later**\n\nAs I let my subconscious take over my mind and let my body rest, I feel sudden warmth wash over the front of my body that pulls me out of my dreary state. As I wake back up I see a sight that honestly surprises me more than anything.\n\n“A-Aubrey?!” I… well I can’t really say shout cause I didn’t wake up anyone, but I can’t say whisper cause it was a bit too loud to be a whisper. Shisper? Whout? I don’t know… Anyway, Aubrey just ended up crawling into my bed.\n\n“Qu-quite down, you’ll wake everyone up.”\n\n“H-how can I be quite? You just get into my bed withou-“\n\n“I’m using this as my favor from you, o-okay?”\n\nMy favor for her? Oh right, from our Guilty Gear match. …Why’s she using it now?\n\n“Why now-“\n\n“G-god, this is embarrassing…” Aubrey said with her face being so red that if it were any redder, it might illuminate the room, “I… I had a nightmare.”\n\n“‘Scuse?”\n\n“Look, I’ve been having them a lot after you kil- after Mari died. They use to be pretty frequent and *really* bad, and my home situation didn’t help, but they eventually calmed down. It’s just that… after you told us everything, they came back and tonight’s was probably the worst one I’ve had in years and I remembered how you used to sleep with Mari in 5th grade when you had nightmares during our sleepovers and- goddamnit, I sound like such an immature dumbass, I’ll go back to the couch. Sorry I woke you…”\n\nOkay Sunny, it’s do or die, don’t fuck this up, “N-no, it’s fine. If you feel more comfortable here, then I’m fine with letting you sleep with me. A-and if you need a place to stay, mom ‘n I will welcome you in open arms.”\n\n“O-oh, thanks… I’ll try to be out of here before everyone wakes up s-so, uh, g-goodnight.” \n\n“Yeah, ‘night.”\n\nNot gonna lie, I-I feel really happy right now, I’ve had a crush on her for *years* and actually being in the same bed is something I’d never imagine happening. Just sleep, Sunny, you need the rest cause you’re heart’s gonna explode.\n\n*Click*\n\nWhat was that?\n\n——\n\nBasil’s Memories 2:\n\n7/19:\n\n>A photo of the apartment complex Sunny lives in.\n\n>So here we are, Sunny’s new home. It's kinda strange to see him in a different place, after so long of not seeing him. I’d love to see how he and his mom decorated the new apartment.”\n\n7/19:\n\n>A second photo of Sunny’s apartment, but Mari is taking up the whole frame, it’s kinda blurry because Basil flinched just before he hit the button to take a picture.\n\n>”Mari!? Why’s she here?! I saw her die but she alive?! I-I have no idea what’s going on! Is she here for revenge for what I’ve done? Hero and Sunny seem to know more about this than anyone so maybe they could tell us.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A photo of the gang smiling at the camera, Kel, Hero, and Mari are posing and smiling like idiots, Aubrey’s giving a thumbs up, Sunny is barely outside the frame, and Basil is taking up the majority of the frame because it’s a selfie.\n\n>”So Mari just wants to see us grow in life, well that’s a relief. I guess now that we know most the unknowns, things can really start going back to how things used to be.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A photo of Hero playing Jr. Pac-Man while Mari cheers him on, Hero’s on his 17th maze.\n\n>”Hero’s always been the resident Pac-Maniac of Faraway, he actually was able to reach level 256 in the original Pac-Man at one point, and it all started with Jr. Pac-Man apparently. Honestly, I don’t know why Jr.’s the one he goes with cause everyone knows Ms. Pac-Man is the best one, but, eh, to each their own.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Sunny and Aubrey playing GGX2#R with a small crowd around them.\n\n>”They’ve been at it for an hour! Those two really like fighting games and always got really competitive when playing years ago, which is really strange for Sunny at least because his typical game of choice is usually an RPG. They’ve even gotten the attention of some of the other fighting game players that come here.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Basil’s point of view as he and Sunny play Mega Man: The Power Battle; Sunny is playing as Bass and Basil is playing as Proto Man, they just beat the Yellow Devil.\n\n>”Who knew Mega Man had an arcade game? Better question, how knew there were two? I’ve always been a huge fan of Mega Man, something about the challenge is so thrilling to me. Having a Mega Man game be solely built around fighting the bosses is such an interesting concept to me and it’s a shame they were never ported to any console.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Kel and Hero playing NBA Jam, Kel’s playing as the Sacramento Kings, Hero’s playing as the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n>”Ah, NBA Jam, while it’s not as realistic as modern Basketball games, it’s always been more fun. It’s dumb and kinda cartoony, but that’s its charm and the gameplay always felt so slick.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of the friend group plus Sunny’s mom singing happy birthday to Sunny, to his embarrassment.\n\n>”Sunny’s never really liked it when we sang happy birthday, always saying it’s ‘dumb’ or ‘immature for people our age’. Oh, Sunny, never change.\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>An attempted recreation of the birthday cake image in the original Photo Album, but Sunny and Kel couldn’t hold a straight face when they actually tried to recreate the shot.\n\n>”Yeah, maybe I should stick to candid shots. Clearly, this didn’t work out too well.”\n\n7/20  - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Hero and Mari sleeping together.\n\n>There’s not much to say here, they’re back together and happier than ever. I’m really happy for them.”\n\n7/2~~0~~1\n\n>A picture of Sunny and Aubrey sleeping together, the handwriting for the description is kinda messy cause Basil was half asleep when writing it.\n\n>”Aubrey was having nightmares and wanted to sleep with Sunny. I always knew those two had a mutual crush on each other, they just need to say it. If this is the spark they need to kick it off, I’ll be happy for them.”",

Sunny is being haunted by Mari’s ghost, Hero knows, Slice of Life Fic, yadda yadda yadda. This is the Sunny birthday special that was meant to be posted yesterday but I got sidetracked with other things.\n\n#Chapter 4: Happy Birthday Sunny! Let’s Hit Up The Arcade!\n\n——\n\n**Faraway but Nearby**\n\nPhotographsynthesis: So, does everyone have their money for the bus fare?\n\nBallin’Kel: Ye\n\nDr.ChefChip: Yep, yep. : \n\nEggplanted_Bat: Yeah.\n\nPhotographsynthesis: Great! :D Now all that’s left is to wait until tomorrow and we’re all set!\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: whatre you guy talking about\n\nEggplanted_Bat: Your birthday, you dork. We’re coming over. Did you forget it’s in two days?\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: uh\n\nPhotographsynthesis: S-Sunny, did you actually forget? ~_~\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: no\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: yes\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: mom and i arent prepared for guests at the moment could you just save this for another time\n\nBallin’Kel: Nop\n\nBallin’Kel: Al r schedz r ony opn 4 te nex few daz n we cnt resched @ th@ pont\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: well bring your own stuff to sleep on cause we don’t have time to prepare for 4 people coming over\n\nEggplanted_Bat: How on earth are you able to decider that?!\n\nDr.ChefChip: Sure, we can probably throw together makeshift beds with some blankets and pillows like when Kel and I stayed at your place before you moved. : \n\nEggplanted_Bat: Dibs on the couch.\n\nBallin’Kel: boo\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: so i cant talk you guys out of this\n\nEggplanted_Bat: Nope\n\nBallin’Kel: n\n\nDr.ChefChip: You’ll be stuck with us for a few days whether you like it or not. ;P\n\nPhotographsynthesis: You better start getting excited!!! >u<\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: alright alright\n\n**Direct Messages: Overcoming_Tulip —> Dr.ChefCook**\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: this is a terrible idea hero\n\nDr.ChefChip: Come on Sunny, it’s gonna be fine. : \n\nOvercoming_Tulip: no no its not\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: all that trauma is gonna hit everyone again like a freight train the mari\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: dont you remember how you reacted when you saw her \n\nDr.ChefChip: I know we’ve talked about this constantly, but look, in reality we have no idea how they’ll react they see her. All we can do is hope this goes well.\n\nDr.ChefChip: Besides, everyone wants to see you in real life again. :D\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: fine\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: just\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: just dont expect that thingsll be hunky dory when they see her\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: capiche\n\nDr.ChefChip: Okay, okay. Chill.\n\nDr.ChefChip: Have more faith in your friends. :/\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: yeah\n\nOvercoming_Tulip: sorry, anxiety and unfounded worries and all that\n\n——\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/o6vbUHCtkJo \n\n“Great…” I mumble and lean back into my chair, “This is just peachy.”\n\n“Ah, Sunny, what’s wrong?” Mari said floating down from the above apartment.\n\n“What were you- whatever, everyone’s coming over for a few days.” I say as I swivel around to face Mari.\n\n“Right, your 16th birthday’s coming up! …But that doesn’t answer my question.”\n\n“I guess I’m just anxious about everyone else seeing you again. I know I’ve talked to both you and Hero about it over the past few weeks, hell, it’s probably been the exact same conversation word for word a few times, but it’s just eating away at me.”\n\nMari softly sighs and puts her hands on my shoulders, causing a soft, cold feeling to spread across the top 1/8 of my body, “I’m sure everything’s going to be okay, so don’t worry.”\n\n“The last time someone told me, ‘everything’s going to be okay’, I lost an eye, so don’t exactly believe in that statement very much.”\n\n“You *really* shouldn’t be such a cynic about this Sunny.”\n\n“…Kay.”\n\n“Good, now let’s get prepared!” Mari exclaims as… she floats back to the above apartment. What on earth is she doing up there?\n\n“Well? Are you not scared of what will happen when they meet?”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/YIBtPYyEaRE \n\nOh you gotta be… you know what, screw it! I’m not gonna deal with this tank top and boxer-wearing dick that’s just reclining on my bed!\n\n“Piss off, Omori, I’m already dealing with a bit of a crisis. Could you save this till next week or something?”\n\n“Unfortunately for you Sunny, I will not ‘piss off', as I am your depression, suicidal thoughts, etcetera, etcetera. You can not exactly get rid of me so easily. I also do not exactly appreciate being thought of as a ‘tank top and boxer wearing dick’.” Omori said while twirling a knife in my face to taunt me.\n\nOh god, he’s speaking in purple prose now… also he can read my mind, but eh, that’s to be expected considering he’s part of me.\n\n“Look, could you just leave me alone for a bit? I don’t need the physical embodiment of my mental illness bug-“\n\n“Sunny?” Mari said with her head peering through the above floor, “Who are you talking to?”\n\nOkay, seems like Mari can’t see Omori, noted.\n\n“Just thinking aloud, sis, sorry if I’m worrying you.”\n\nMari sighs and goes back to whatever the hell she was doing in the upstairs apartment.\n\n“Fine, I will leave you be for now. Just know that I am always watching.” Omori said as he slowly fades.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, whatever asshole.”\n\n^“Oh, ^kill ^yourself ^Patch ^the ^Pirate.”\n\n“Oh, now you talk like a normal person?!”\n\nOh yeah, I don’t think I’ve mentioned this cause, you know, I was just dealing with him, but Omori’s been pestering me for the past few weeks after he revealed himself when Hero came over. I’m not really afraid of him anymore cause at this point he’s just a mild nuisance, like a middle schooler trying, and failing, to harass a college student. He’s not doing enough to actually cause me mental distress, but enough to annoy me. Anyway, I gotta prepare for everyone coming over.\n\n——\n\n**The Next Day**\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/DO-lltf8W_4 \n\nToday’s the big day and, goddamn, have I been dreading it. Everyone mentioned they’d be here by 8:45 PM and it’s 8:44, just one more minutes and-\n\n*Beeeeeeep*\n\n“Heya Sunny, it’s Basil! Everyone’s here an-“\n\n“Hi Sunny! Sally’s doing well if you’re wondering.”\n\n“Kel, please let me finish before speaking up. Anyway, everyone’s here and getting their stuff out of the bus, so if you can, could you and your mom help us carry everything in if you can?”\n\n^”Look, ^the ^bat’s ^just ^for ^show, ^sir. ^I’m ^not ^gonna ^hit ^anyone ^with ^it. ^Give ^me ^a ^hammer ^and ^I’ll ^rip ^the ^nails ^right ^now ^if ^it ^makes ^you ^feel ^comfortable.”\n\n^”Aubrey, ^just, ^why ^did ^you ^bring ^your ^bat ^with ^you?”\n\n^”I ^bring ^it ^everywhere, ^Hero, ^no ^exceptions.”\n\n^”Even ^to ^school?!”\n\n^”…Yes.”\n\n“Uhh, yeah, could you get over here before Aubrey starts a fistfight with the bus driver? I-I’d rather not have her get arrested for assault… this would be incredibly awkward if I input the wrong code.”\n\n*Bzzt*\n\nAh crap. Okay, okay, you can do this Sunny, just let everyone in and deal with the whole Mari thing later.\n\n“Everyone’s here, mom, I’ll be right back.”\n\n“Alright honey, make sure you help them bring their stuff in if you can.”\n\nOkay, grab the spare keys for the gate door in case I accidentally lock myself out, head out the door, and-\n\n“Oh boy, I can’t wait to see everyone again!”\n\nGuess I’m dealing with *this* a lot sooner than later… goddamnit!\n\nIn a hushed tone, so mom doesn’t hear me seemingly talking to myself, I say to Mari, “Please, I am begging you here, save this until later. I’m not sure how Kel, Basil, and Aubrey are gonna react to seeing you, especially after nearly six hours of travel.”\n\n“Sorry Sunny, but I’ve been waiting for this for so long, I’m not taking no for an answer.” Mari said before rushing ahead to the front gate. Oh, I absolutely hate everything right now.\n\nAlright, out the door I go and to the front gate I head. I swear to god Mari ends up traumatizing them again, I’m gonna… uh, I can’t think of a facetious threat. Whatever, not the point, I’m close to the gate, I see Mari trying to talk to everyone who just arrived, Kel, Aubrey, and Basil are trying not to freak out… fuck. On the bright side, Hero at least looks pretty happy.\n\n“Uh… hey guys! Look, Hero and I will explain in the morning, I know this is certainly… bizarre too, uh, you know. Just don’t worry about it for now.”\n\nBasil barely holding it together, stammers “B-but, sh-she should b-b-b-be-“\n\nI put a single finger to my lip to single him to stop talking, there are more people than just us here and I’d rather not cause a scene. On that note, Hero turns to the rest of the group and says, “Come on guys, let’s get everything inside. We’ve got a big day tomorrow and we need rest.”\n\n——\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/xbvRW3n5-aQ \n\n**The Next Day… again**\n\n“…and that’s everything that you need to know.” \n\nEveryone sits in stunned silence as Hero, Mari, and I finish explaining the whole ghost situation. Luckily, mom had just left for work around two hours before we started so we didn’t have to deal with her thinking we were completely insane.\n\n“Normally I’d think the three of you were insane, but I’m actually talking to a goddamn ghost.” Aubrey said while rubbing her temples, “I have no idea how to feel…”\n\nMari puts her hand on her chin inquisitively, “But I already showed myself to you, so it shouldn’t be that much of a surprise.”\n\nHold on, what? Now everyone’s taken aback, Basil being the first to ask, “What do you mean?!”\n\nRealization dawns on Aubrey, “You… you’re talking about that dream I had on the night of Sunny and Basil’s fight. You were begging me to wake up cause you knew they’d die if we didn’t call an ambulance soon.”\n\n“Ding, ding, ding! That’s right! And it’s a good thing that you listened to me, given that you were the first to find them.” Mari said with a wide smile.\n\nRight, Mari can enter dreams, so that makes sense.\n\nMari turns to Kel with a smug look to ask, “So what does Mr. ghost hunter think of my existence?~”\n\n“What in the world are- …Hero told you about my horror phase, didn’t he?” Kel said, slowly shrinking into his seat due to embarrassment.\n\n“Yep, yep.”\n\n“Don’t remind me, that was a very embarrassing time in my life...”\n\n“Hehe, I’m probably gonna tease you for that for the rest of your life.”\n\nWhile it kinda seems like everyone’s slowly getting accustomed to the whole ghost thing, Basil seems kinda uncomfortable about the whole thing. Mari takes note of this.\n\n“Hey Basil, what’s wrong?”\n\n“It-it’s, uh, it’s just… I’m, uh, it’s-“\n\nOh, I get what he wants to say, but Basil’s just a tad bit too afraid to say it, so I might as well say for him.\n\n“Basil’s afraid that you hate him for helping me cover up how you were killed.”\n\n“S-Sunny!”\n\nMari is taken aback, but also understanding given the circumstances and tries to reassure him by saying, “Basil, it’s fine… but I’m not really in the position to be affected by what you did, given that I was already dead.”\n\n“O-oh, but you have to at least think that what I did was absolutely horrible and-“\n\nMari lets out a sigh and says, “It was, it was something that was truly horrid, but doing something terrible doesn’t make you a bad person. It’s more than clear that you hate what you did and you want to grow from it. I don’t want to hold anything against you.”\n\n“Oh! Well, uh, th-thanks Mari.”\n\nHuh, guess Hero was right. Speaking of Hero, he clanks a glass he has with a fork to get everyone’s attention, “Now that we’ve got the full group truly together again, I think there’s something important we have to do.”\n\nEveryone nods and gather to the front of where I’m standing, they clear their throats and in unison say,\n\n#”Happy Birthday, Sunny!”\n\n“Oh, uh… thanks, guys.”\n\nRight, I’m turning 16 today, huh, it’s kinda strange, especially considering that my dead sister is *also* celebrating with me.\n\n“And since it’s your big day, you get to choose where we hang out today.” Kel said as a joking punched me on the arm.\n\n“Hmm, how about the arcade down the street, maybe I can get back to kicking all your asses in Guilty Gear.” I say with a cocky grin, Hobbeez and Gino’s always switched out arcade machines every three or four months and I always tended to gravitate towards fighting games. I’d like to think I was fairly okay at them, Tekken 3 was fairly fun but not my best, King of Fighters 97 was okay but not really my cup of tea, Killer Instinct was a lot of fun with all the ultra combos, but Guilty Gear was my main fighting game. It’s kinda jank and unbalanced in multiple areas,  but something about how the characters played just clicked with me, *especially* Dr. Baldhead.\n\n“Okay, smart ass, I’ll take you up on that. We’re still 1-1 after you got pissed off during our Street Fighter II match.” Aubrey said with the smuggest look possible.\n\n“That was the Rainbow Edition bootleg and you know that doesn’t count!”\n\n“Sure, sure, whatever you sore loser.”\n\nWe laugh it off, grab some of the money and head out to the arcade… I  honestly don’t know what they have there, so this’ll be an interesting new experience.\n\n——\n\n**5 minutes later**\n\n BGM  https://youtu.be/aTfDtUFiquY \n\nAh, the arcade, all sorts of sound full the air that almost entirely makes the music near impossible to hear, be it the sounds from the games being played or the excited cheers of a small crowd of people nearby playing what looks to be a new version of Street Fighter III; the last time I left my home, the latest version of that game was Second Impact, so I guess I missed out on whatever new content was added to it. We got our quarters, now where in the world is Guilty Gear? Ah, maybe the guy at the counter should be able to point me in the right direction.\n\n^”Oh ^hey, ^the ^Konami ^Simpsons ^Beat ^‘em ^Up! ^Basil, ^come ^on, ^we ^gotta ^play ^that ^thing ^again ^Basil!”\n\n^“Gah, ^Kel, ^h-hold ^on ^a ^sec!”\n\n^“Oh ^hey, ^Pac-Man ^Jr., ^man ^I ^loved ^playing ^that ^as ^a ^kid. ^Mari, ^wanna ^check ^it ^out?”\n\n^“Sure, ^sure, ^maybe ^you ^can ^show ^me ^some ^of ^your ^sick ^skills~”\n\n“Hey, excuse me, sir, do you have a Guilty Gear cabinet here?”\n\n“If you’re talking about the first game, then no.”\n\n“Wait, ‘first’? There were sequels?!”\n\n“Woah, calm down buddy, but yeah, there were two sequels. The latest version of the second sequel came out a while in Japan and my boss’ friend who lives there actually got it exported here recently. We did have to modify the thing so it accepts quarters but I’m not 100% sure it won’t just eat them occasionally. It’s near the back, it’s called Guilty Gear X2 #Reload. Also if you’re playing with someone, don’t play as I-No, the woman with the witch hat and guitar. She’s the boss character and has caused at least five fistfights.”\n\n“Gotcha, thanks, sir!”\n\nI back head over where Aubrey is to tell her.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, you don’t have to tell me, I heard you and the clerk talking about it. It’s a new game, it’s in the back, don’t play as Ee No or whatever her name is, right? Well, let’s get going.”\n\nAs we walk through the arcade, I see a vast array of games both new to me and some that I remember. Marvel Vs Capcom 2, Donkey Kong 3, Mega Man: The Power Battle, Final Fight, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, Tekken Tag Tournament, Dance Dance Revolution, and so many more.\n\n “Ah, there it is! You ready to get beat, Ms. ‘Best Ky in Faraway’?”\n\n“Oh, shut up Baldy.”\n\n“If anything, I’m less like Baldhead and more like Baiken.”\n\n“Baiken?”\n\n“Baiken, the secret boss from the original Guilty Gear. I accidentally ended up fighting her, when You, Basil, Kel, and I when we tried to go through the single-player as Sol… and lost. She lost an eye, is Japanese, ^has ^an ^affinity ^for ^sharp ^objects- “\n\n“Stop fantasizing and put your quarters in the machine. ^’Affinity ^for ^sharp ^objects’? ^Sunny, ^are ^you ^okay? “ Aubrey said as she rested her bat on the side of this glorious, giant hunk of metal.\n\nWe insert 2 quarters each into the cabinet, each causing a loud but short jingle to play. \n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/zN50auhrsAw \n\nFinally, we reach the characters roster, man there are so many new faces, let’s see… Oh hey, Justice and Baiken’re playable now, neat! Aside from them, there’s this scantily clad blue-haired angle girl, a young nun, a guy with glasses and a bandana, and a robotic version of Ky are a few of the stand-out newcomers, but there is one notable absence.\n\n“Where’s Baldhead?” I say with the most disappointed look I could give, causing Aubrey to chuckle.\n\n“Well, looks you gotta find a new main. At least *I* still got Ky.”\n\n“That’s cause Ky’s essentially the Ken of Guilty Gear, excluding him would just be like Arc System Works pulled a Mortal Kombat 3. …I’ll go with this guy with the bag on his head, he looks like the type of weird character I usually play.”\n\nOnce I actually select the bag guy, whose name is Faust, I notice something, he has the same suit and giant scalpel that Baldhead had, guess he’s using a new name.\n\n“*What was that about finding a new main?*”\n\n“Oh shut up and choose your character.”\n\n“Okay, okay.”\n\nWe select our characters, choose a stage, and start the match.\n\n **BGM  Note: Only let it play till 1:26:50 **  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V9khT_IUXUk&amp;amp;t=5196s \n\n“Hopefully you haven’t gotten too rusty, birthday boy.”\n\n“Same goes to you, Ms. Punk.”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/mt3UWNYVDDI \n\nBoth Faust and Ky do their into animations as Ky’s theme starts playing. Even though Baldhead/Faust is my main, I always thought Ky’s theme was the best out of the first game’s soundtrack, and this new remix is even better.\n\n“Heh, looks like the game *wants* me to win if it’s blasting my character’s theme.”\n\n“Don’t get too cocky yet, we just started.”\n\nI’ll spare you the details of the fight and get back to you after we’re done.  Author’s Note: Or from the writer’s perspective, I haven’t played #Reload, I’ve only played AC+R and I’m not sure how much the flow of battle differs between the two and I’m not don’t know how to write an interesting fight ing game  scene without visuals, so, uh, just imagine the fight went something like  this  https://youtu.be/SjnyMxCgbY0  but at a smoother frame rate and actual game audio. \n\n——\n\n**2 minutes later**\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/72X305iMLwc \n\n“Wow, I really *am* rusty, huh.”\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/aTfDtUFiquY \n\n“Good game, Sunny, you really gave me a run for my money.” Aubrey said while extending her arm for a handshake.\n\n“Yeah, good game to you too.” I say as I do the same.\n\n“Now that we finally settled that SF2 thing, *you* owe *me* a favor like you said you would when we made that bet a few years ago.”\n\n“You actually remember that bet? Yeesh, talk about holding onto something.”\n\n“Oh be quiet you, we still gotta lotta time before we should head back to your place, let’s keep playing.”\n\n——\n\n**6 Hours Later**\n\n **BGM**  https://youtu.be/DO-lltf8W_4 \n\nNot much else really happened of note in the arcade, a lot of the time was just us focusing on whatever games any combination of the group with little actual discussion. Mari was also mostly being a cheerleader to the people she was around while playing the game. After getting home, using the shower, and switching into our night clothes, we had dinner, which was some really juicy steak prepared by my mom, and began eating the cake Hero made in preparation, which was a mix of Chocolate and Vanilla, with the batter apparently having cinnamon sugar mixed into it and various berries and some mochi being toppers. It’s great to see Hero’s getting back into cooking as a hobby at least. Also as a side note, apparently Aubrey’s hair dye isn’t as strong as she thought it was because the top half of her hair lost its pink hue, showing her almost completely bleached blonde hair from the top of her head to a bit below her neck and the two front strands being tipped with pink.\n\nOh right, presents! Kel and Hero got me, and by extension, Mari, sheet music from the old grand piano that arrived a few days ago. It was mostly some classics and obscure stuff we didn’t have back when Mari and I played piano, like Clair de Lune and Ilyinsky - Noure et Anitra, Op. 13: No. 7, Berceuse Harrison Sheckler being standouts. Aubrey made a custom pinwheel that has six propellers, each being a different color, those being blue, orange, green, pink, purple, and white. Lastly, Basil gave me the set of Vandas he was growing a few weeks ago. There were also cards from the people that we helped out back in Faraway, most of which were well-wishes with about $5-$25 included in each. While it was very much low-key, I honestly really enjoyed my time with everyone today. \n\nMom decided to call it a night so it’s just the six of us in the dining room discussing our plans for tomorrow.\n\n“So, we’ll be hitting the beach tomorrow?” I say with a mouth full of cake.\n\n“Yep! Hope you have some sunscreen and trunks.” Basil said after swallowing fork’s worth of cake.\n\n“Hmm, that might be a bit of a problem for me at least…”\n\n“What did you outgrow them? I’ll let you borrow mine from when I was fifteen.” Kel said jokingly.\n\n“First off, gross. Second, no, it’s not that, most of my old clothes still fit me. It’s that I don’t want anything irritating my eye socket cause I’m going back to the hospital to get my glass eye. The doctor said not to let anything happen  to it or else it might cause complications with it getting installed.” I say as I cut my piece of cake with my fork.\n\n“I mean, you could just not swim and just chill on the shore.”\n\n“That’s sho- Mari? Y-you know you physically can’t eat, right?”\n\nMari’s trying to gnaw at my fork to get a taste of Hero’s cake.\n\n“H-hey, I just wanna taste Hero’s food after so long. And the good news is that I think I can finally taste stuff, that sweet and rich chocolate and vanilla enhanced by the cinnamon is to die! Just a little longer and I’ll master this ghostly form of mine.” Mari said as she was beaming with joy.\n\n“That’s great! Anyway, back on topic, just relaxing in the sandy area should be fine, but what if I get a face full of sand.”\n\n“You have an eyepatch, I doubt anything is getting through there, you’re just being paranoid for no reason.” Aubrey said as she put her plate in the dishwasher.\n\n“I- yeah, true.”\n\nHero yawned as he finished his cup of tea he brewed for himself, “Guy, it’s getting late. Can we just hit the hay and worry about this tomorrow?”\n\nI glance over to the clock and realize that it’s nearly 11. Wow, we, uh, we really lost track of time.\n\n“Eh, yeah, sounds good, night, guys.” Aubrey said as she retreated to the couch.\n\n“Yeah, should get some rest.” Basil says as exhaustion starts to wash over him.\n\n“The party doesn’t truly end until we get back home, so let’s kick back and relax until tomorrow!” Kel shouts.\n\n^”Kel! ^Shut ^the ^hell ^up ^before ^I ^bash ^your ^skull ^in! ^I’m ^trying ^to ^sleep!”\n\n“Sorry!”\n\n——\n\n**2 Hours Later**\n\nAs I let my subconscious take over my mind and let my body rest, I feel sudden warmth wash over the front of my body that pulls me out of my dreary state. As I wake back up I see a sight that honestly surprises me more than anything.\n\n“A-Aubrey?!” I… well I can’t really say shout cause I didn’t wake up anyone, but I can’t say whisper cause it was a bit too loud to be a whisper. Shisper? Whout? I don’t know… Anyway, Aubrey just ended up crawling into my bed.\n\n“Qu-quite down, you’ll wake everyone up.”\n\n“H-how can I be quite? You just get into my bed withou-“\n\n“I’m using this as my favor from you, o-okay?”\n\nMy favor for her? Oh right, from our Guilty Gear match. …Why’s she using it now?\n\n“Why now-“\n\n“G-god, this is embarrassing…” Aubrey said with her face being so red that if it were any redder, it might illuminate the room, “I… I had a nightmare.”\n\n“‘Scuse?”\n\n“Look, I’ve been having them a lot after you kil- after Mari died. They use to be pretty frequent and *really* bad, and my home situation didn’t help, but they eventually calmed down. It’s just that… after you told us everything, they came back and tonight’s was probably the worst one I’ve had in years and I remembered how you used to sleep with Mari in 5th grade when you had nightmares during our sleepovers and- goddamnit, I sound like such an immature dumbass, I’ll go back to the couch. Sorry I woke you…”\n\nOkay Sunny, it’s do or die, don’t fuck this up, “N-no, it’s fine. If you feel more comfortable here, then I’m fine with letting you sleep with me. A-and if you need a place to stay, mom ‘n I will welcome you in open arms.”\n\n“O-oh, thanks… I’ll try to be out of here before everyone wakes up s-so, uh, g-goodnight.” \n\n“Yeah, ‘night.”\n\nNot gonna lie, I-I feel really happy right now, I’ve had a crush on her for *years* and actually being in the same bed is something I’d never imagine happening. Just sleep, Sunny, you need the rest cause you’re heart’s gonna explode.\n\n*Click*\n\nWhat was that?\n\n——\n\nBasil’s Memories 2:\n\n7/19:\n\n>A photo of the apartment complex Sunny lives in.\n\n>So here we are, Sunny’s new home. It's kinda strange to see him in a different place, after so long of not seeing him. I’d love to see how he and his mom decorated the new apartment.”\n\n7/19:\n\n>A second photo of Sunny’s apartment, but Mari is taking up the whole frame, it’s kinda blurry because Basil flinched just before he hit the button to take a picture.\n\n>”Mari!? Why’s she here?! I saw her die but she alive?! I-I have no idea what’s going on! Is she here for revenge for what I’ve done? Hero and Sunny seem to know more about this than anyone so maybe they could tell us.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A photo of the gang smiling at the camera, Kel, Hero, and Mari are posing and smiling like idiots, Aubrey’s giving a thumbs up, Sunny is barely outside the frame, and Basil is taking up the majority of the frame because it’s a selfie.\n\n>”So Mari just wants to see us grow in life, well that’s a relief. I guess now that we know most the unknowns, things can really start going back to how things used to be.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A photo of Hero playing Jr. Pac-Man while Mari cheers him on, Hero’s on his 17th maze.\n\n>”Hero’s always been the resident Pac-Maniac of Faraway, he actually was able to reach level 256 in the original Pac-Man at one point, and it all started with Jr. Pac-Man apparently. Honestly, I don’t know why Jr.’s the one he goes with cause everyone knows Ms. Pac-Man is the best one, but, eh, to each their own.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Sunny and Aubrey playing GGX2#R with a small crowd around them.\n\n>”They’ve been at it for an hour! Those two really like fighting games and always got really competitive when playing years ago, which is really strange for Sunny at least because his typical game of choice is usually an RPG. They’ve even gotten the attention of some of the other fighting game players that come here.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Basil’s point of view as he and Sunny play Mega Man: The Power Battle; Sunny is playing as Bass and Basil is playing as Proto Man, they just beat the Yellow Devil.\n\n>”Who knew Mega Man had an arcade game? Better question, how knew there were two? I’ve always been a huge fan of Mega Man, something about the challenge is so thrilling to me. Having a Mega Man game be solely built around fighting the bosses is such an interesting concept to me and it’s a shame they were never ported to any console.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Kel and Hero playing NBA Jam, Kel’s playing as the Sacramento Kings, Hero’s playing as the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n>”Ah, NBA Jam, while it’s not as realistic as modern Basketball games, it’s always been more fun. It’s dumb and kinda cartoony, but that’s its charm and the gameplay always felt so slick.”\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of the friend group plus Sunny’s mom singing happy birthday to Sunny, to his embarrassment.\n\n>”Sunny’s never really liked it when we sang happy birthday, always saying it’s ‘dumb’ or ‘immature for people our age’. Oh, Sunny, never change.\n\n7/20 - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>An attempted recreation of the birthday cake image in the original Photo Album, but Sunny and Kel couldn’t hold a straight face when they actually tried to recreate the shot.\n\n>”Yeah, maybe I should stick to candid shots. Clearly, this didn’t work out too well.”\n\n7/20  - SUNNY’S BIRTHDAY:\n\n>A picture of Hero and Mari sleeping together.\n\n>There’s not much to say here, they’re back together and happier than ever. I’m really happy for them.”\n\n7/2~~0~~1\n\n>A picture of Sunny and Aubrey sleeping together, the handwriting for the description is kinda messy cause Basil was half asleep when writing it.\n\n>”Aubrey was having nightmares and wanted to sleep with Sunny. I always knew those two had a mutual crush on each other, they just need to say it. If this is the spark they need to kick it off, I’ll be happy for them.” https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/op1nm3/happily_haunted_chapter_4_sunnys_birthday_special/",

   "title": "Thoughts on the game, and extra. (continued in comments)",
   "body": "I am going to warn you, there are going to be some heavy spoilers involving the true route if you've skipped the tag and haven't beaten the game yourself yet. Read at your own risk if you don't plan on playing the game or some thought along those lines. A disclaimer that I may portray your favorite character in a more negative light based on what I know and think, so this post might become unpalatable to you. Well, you can also assume I did not do so great in English class because my thoughts are all over the place. It's quite stream of consciousness. I might repeat myself.\n\nHmm, I guess I could start off with my thoughts on the main six of the cast. I'll add some puns after each of the six because....why not?\n\nMari is my favorite, because although I do know she wasn't as perfect as others thought she was, she certainly did her best and was as kind as Sunny remembers her by. I also like listening to music with piano in it. She really did love Sunny, and he loved her back equally in return, if you piece together some bits and pieces on the true route, and in the Backyard Area in Black Space if you look off the cliff there's some Final Duet memories down there too. Kind of wish my sister was more like Mari too in terms of emotionally being there for me, though I knew she couldn't. Maybe that they were both perfectionists is the closest I can get, but my sister didn't enjoy that, so I doubt Mari did either and she was just trying to be a good role model or big sis for Sunny, or just the pressure of being the firstborn child which Mari could have shared with Hero. The reason why it took a turn for the worse and the incident happened is both because of cram school for college prep, and possibly Basil...but I'll get back to him later. She was really stressed out at the time too, and when Sunny needed a hug more than anything else like she always gave him, she tore into him instead or reprimanded him, \"How could you?\" or \"Don't you know how much effort your friends put into getting you that violin?\", maybe both those lines, one of them, and all the more. You can kind of see it in the truth photos that Mari was talking to him before he pushed her down. Looking at the truth photos even without the text that the wiki has or going through the files, and my personal experience with stairs, I don't think in any way she could have survived that. It looks like she fell backwards around 1/2 or 1/3 of the way on the stairs, bounced at least once if she covered half the distance and boy, those are some jagged looking stairs, probably broke her back then smashed into the violin with her front...sorry for the morbid picture but...that's how I see and feel how it happened. The worst that's happened to me is I slipped on my heel down some carpeted stairs, then just tumbled all the way down and slammed into the coat rack, not sure if headfirst or not. I think I got to experience the back pain of an old man for a while, and had to be carried up to my bed to rest. It still hurts thinking about it...^(sometimes I do wonder if I received any brain damage because of that too, but maybe it's just because it's easy for me to recognize when I'm being stupid.) I'll spoiler this part because it's a little gruesome. >!Throughout my childhood because I was clumsy, I ended up losing a few toenails to marble stairs, if not wooden stairs too while going up them barefoot or in slippers if it's outdoors. Sometimes fingernails too, sometimes it was only the white part, but sometimes I lost the up to half of the pink part too. It was an unpleasant and painful experience. Granted, recently I've tripped up only three steps while coming up from the basement on some old wooden stairs that had edges just as sharp in the truth photos, and I got a really nasty bruise that ended up turning purple later, and losing a quarter of my big toenail again.!< Stairs are pretty brutal, and that's only with me falling up or down like 1~5 steps on non-carpeted stairs. I can only imagine what happened to Mari. I find her sense of playfulness relatable. Gelatin is gelatin, after all. Maybe her consideration for others as well, but that's a trait she shares with Sunny too, or at least from what I know.\n\nWhat would have the police report on the incident with Mari be called?\n>!The staircase!<\n\nI hold Hero >!or Henry!< in high regards too. I know he wasn't naturally perfect though, I recognize he still put in the effort and made use of his talent to get where he was. He's actually the character I know the least about in comparison to Mari despite interacting with him in the Dream World and the present, I just know he's a nice guy and he's capable of being there for everyone, and a good cook too. His arachnophobia certainly got worse after Mari's death though. He was one of the characters who was hit the hardest by Mari's death though, considering everyone and their mother knew how close they were to each other, probably even considered them unofficially married. Actually, I can infer how terrible he felt at the time, because the present day dialogue when Kel asks Hero what is he going to do when he's no longer around to kill the spider for him, and Hero is like, \"What do you mean?\" It hits incredibly hard because he felt the same way for Mari, but she was suddenly gone and that he thought it was suicide made the pain exponentially worse. Between him, Kel, and Aubrey, who thought Mari committed suicide, he blamed himself the most for not seeing the signs that never existed, and ended up closing himself off from the world for an entire year until Kel waltzed in and ended up triggering him. One thing I don't like about him is how he chooses the middle ground though, like lukewarm tofu? Really? Even if he did pick a side, like let's say he picked Kel over Aubrey in the Dream World or the past while scratching his head and winking with one eye saying, \"Sorry Aubrey, but you're not the one catching the spiders for me.\", Aubrey would say that she could do it too, then Hero would still go back to, \"Then you can both catch spiders for me!\" and go back to making Kel and Aubrey feeling disappointed.  I've had someone like Hero in my life there for me, he wasn't any hero, but he certainly broke up some of the few fights I had with other kids, even if it was only at church on Sundays. \n\nThe word for saying someone has hero like qualities and also calling Hero gross?\n>!Heroic. Although, the k sound on just ick is a bit sharper...but whatever.!<\n\nAlso yes, while we're on Hero puns, Gator Aid is referring to the sports drink. \n\nWell, here we are at Sunny, but before I get into the warm, fuzzy stuff, I will state that I do feel that Sunny might have DID, considering he separated himself from Omori, and is also talking to himself through different characters he has made all throughout the Dream World, and I think Humphrey is a double layer of that, or maybe even critique of the Dream World, because Humphrey is both talking to Sunny while also talking to himself and...whatever. I'm no psychologist but I think you get the gist of what I'm thinking, but also I won't diagnose him in any way, I just think he might have DID post trauma, but it could be just DA...or maybe some really bad depression and he's trying to focus on only his good memories. I don't really know either. Well, Mewo and the stray cats like Sunny, and I like cats, therefore I like Sunny. Nothing more to it. I kid you, I like Sunny because he's as kind as Mari and loves everyone, you can see all the subtle nuances in which he cares for his friends all throughout the Dream World, and his past home where he goes to retrieve his violin. His friends are colored purple, which if you assume from Memory Lane that Aubrey wanted to dye her hair pink because it was her favorite color, then Mari's was purple and it's also symbolic that these are how Sunny remembers his friends were like when Mari was around. This also is shown by Dream Basil in how he's blanched and almost devoid of color, because it was sucked out of him to create Stranger. The Orange Joe quest actually was a representation of his friendship between Sunny and Kel, this is inferring from the photo album that Sunny's favorite fruit was lemons...or oragnes since Mari got him lemon ice cream, and also Orange Joe was throwing stuff around like Kel would, along with being a reference to the soda and Kel's favorite flavor being orange. The sad part about this though, was unlike Oragne Joe, the hope that Sunny created didn't come true when Orange Joe came into being. Kel did end up helping Sunny later, but I'll continue with Kel related stuff later. I think Sunny valued Aubrey second most to Mari considering how many Watermelons there were in the Dream World, and how much useful stuff you could get from them, you learn later that Aubrey's favorite fruit is watermelon. There's also one of the books where Sunny laid on Aubrey's shoulder and told himself he would cherish that memory forever. There's some hinting that they both had a thing for each other in Memory Lane too, and maybe even some more on the present day on the swings or when she's left alone with Sunny when Kel and Hero already went through the patio door. [Also this was the second most painful thing in the game to me.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/405230654624628749/840373696668762122/how_much_did_sunny_really_need_aubrey.png) It's just an empty cardboard box...was it the weight of his sins or something? Did he really feel so helpless? Was he that weak? I don't know myself. It hurt more than anything else on the Hikikomori route to me. I don't know what I can reference to Hero in Headspace besides him being there though. Food heals or something along that line of logic? Being a lucid dreamer myself, I found it especially sweet (despite the psychological horror undertones) that he was always thinking of his friends, and remembered them for who they were (and still are) despite isolating himself for 4 years. You can see how much he cared about Mari since he didn't want to remember her dying again and the picnic blanket and all those things in Headspace, which the voice in the tunnel talks to you about post-Humphrey so I won't go too much into that. He still cares about Basil despite what he's done to him by keeping his entire garden around that you can water throughout the game, and remembers what Basil thinks of his friends through the flowers. No idea why his house is a boot though. If it follows the idea of \"shoes too big to fill\", a theory I do have on him which relies on seeing him as a selfish person and the line in the Photo Album where he calls Sunny the baby of the group and they should take care of him, perhaps that's why everything happened the way it did? I don't know if he idolized Mari or Hero, but maybe he felt responsibility as an older brother to Sunny, and felt the reason that Mari died was his own fault for not being a good role model to Sunny, leading to the cover up and trying to take responsibility for everything, unable to forgive himself until Sunny does in the true secret ending. But this also means it was less about caring about Sunny, and always was about him. If it means new pathways in life, it could represent that it's the entrance to Black Space and if you're on the True Route it's the way to a new beginning, and Hikikomori Route is a new hell. There could be also the implication based on a bad shoe pun where Basil is soulless, because the shoe is soleless. One thing I'm not sure of based on these two ideas are, is it Sunny's or Basil's thoughts? A mix even? The thought of white egret orchids coming into play here would make more sense if some of Basil's terror leaked into Sunny's dreams, no one said you had to be dead for it to work, and that's with the assumption of some supernatural elements at play. Post-Basil fight in Sunny's old house, you learn 5 new things, the tree that was cut down by his father was his favorite tree, Sunny knew Mari was tired because of cram school the entire time before the incident when you interact with the bookcase, if you interact with the lamp, Sunny slept after Mari because he knew she had trouble sleeping and had to turn off the lamp after Mari fell asleep while reading with the light on, interacting with her bed was how reliant Sunny was on Mari to overcome his nightmares, and interacting with his bed and revealing why he stayed in bed all this time, is that it was the most comfortable bed because it was Mari's old bed, and it reminded him of her...and maybe he rated Aubrey's bed as a 10/10 as well but didn't give us the score because...you know. It's all the more touching and sad once you find out those details, how could Sunny be the monster he thought he was? Well, the excerpt from the Lost Library tells you one of the stress factors he had was missing an hour every Saturday that he could have spent with his friends because of the lesson, I think a big plot hole might be why couldn't it be rescheduled, but it could have been about money if not parental neglect, I'm not sure. I did the math and it's about like 35 hrs lost of time that could have been spent with his friends, I know you didn't experience this scenario specifically, but what matters to you more, doing an activity you like or up to 8 hours of the slog that is school, not including the bus ride or homework?...if you didn't like school. But you will be able to understand, if not completely empathize with Sunny, thinking about doing something you like vs. what you don't like. Not to mention because of school taking up a lot of time that he couldn't spend with everyone those Saturday hours became all the more precious. Sunny understood logically why Mari couldn't spend time with him, but he may have felt heavily neglected still. Then there's Basil and Aubrey both complaining to him about things, and it's possible that since Basil was needy and Sunny didn't know how to say no, he ended up breaking promises to meet with Aubrey, among other things. There might be more stress related things that I may have missed, but then it becomes no surprise why things got heated and ended up the way they did. It would have been a lot less tragic from the get go if Basil didn't try to cover it up and they just found Sunny crying at the bed though, but once more I'll get back to Basil later and how he ruined everything for everyone. I am a bit curious about one thing, when have you guys taken a health/sex ed class? Before I learned about male and female genitalia, I must admit that I thought ample bosom or large chest= female and muscles= male. Do you think Sunny thinks the same way and it's not because of bisexuality? Best I could relate to Sunny is maybe having half the imagination he has, and having an older sister. She's only 2 and 9 months older than me though, and Mari is 3 years and 4 months older than Sunny iirc? Well...I'm ashamed to admit this but I did end up grabbing the kitchen knife and standing at the door to her room. I don't know what got into me that day either, and I don't remember much else after that besides no one got hurt physically, not sure about emotional. I do remember slowly walking up the stairs though, maybe I was hoping I would trip and fall on it? I think it was some time in high school though. I don't really know, maybe that's just why it's easier for me to forgive Sunny for what happened because I've done some terrible things, but those things didn't make me a terrible person in the eyes of others. I still think I'm terrible, but it doesn't eat away at me. ^(Sunny being lazy while they built the treehouse is a mood though.) I did find it adorable that he thinks lemons=oragnes and caffeine=coffee...though 150 mg of caffeine is equal to a Starbucks Espresso, Caffè Latte, or Cappucino. Jesus Kel, why do you drink Orange Joe? No idea why lemons are oragnes. Killing Omori didn't bother me that much after the first time, maybe I played too much Persona and treated him as Sunny's shadow? Also interesting to note that he's more of a Black Space entity due to his color scheme and his true nature. Hikikomori route felt revolting because it's one thing to plunge yourself into the abyss, but a whole 'nother feeling to plunge someone else into the abyss, fictional person or not.\n\nWhat is Omori's least favorite style of fried egg?\n>!Sunny side up!<\n\nWhat's Omori's favorite thing to do?\n>!Commit violince!<\n\nWhy is Sunny unable to enter some areas?\n>!Communication is key!<\n\nWell, here's a quote that I felt might fit Sunny/Omori from a game I played: \"On the mirrored edge of infinity, one man sinks forever into darkness, one man rises into light. But which one am I?\" You could google it and find the game if you want. Don't recommend playing it in its current state though.\n\nSo, here we are now at Aubrey. She was living a relatively normal life before her father left, so let's assume her house became the trash heap we see in the present in only 4 years. Those 4 years we didn't see were a rough time for her, her father left around the time Mari died so she had double the layer of suffering, then when she decided to reconnect with Basil and discovered the ruined photos she just flipped out from there. The long dialogue at the stump of Sunny's favorite tree reveals a bit more of how she felt at the time too. From what we see in the game, it seems she doesn't take the initiative whether it's bullying Basil or fighting Sunny and Kel, I think she was feeling inside \"But what about me?\" all the while Kel was only worrying about Basil and completely disregarding her feelings, while antagonizing her. The church part is only because Sunny was impatient though, but Kel still provoked her there, then finally at the lake for the last fight it's just Kel not believing them and starting the fight again. A little thought I'll add here, what if the song \"It Means Everything\" is referring to their memories together, or Basil's photo album, rather than just Aubrey herself? Or it could be her theme and it only changes to the others she's with the Hooligans. It could be both. Noticing her start to cry after the fight and run off, and also all the things that the churchgoers were saying, I actually cried for an hour, or maybe an hour and a half. Not for her though, just...some personal reasons. ^(Well, maybe a little for her too.) It also hurt when not only the Hooligans left her, but her old friends left her at the old hangout spot. It showed that except for Kim, the Hooligans weren't close to Aubrey like her old friend group, and even then with the lines Kim has while worrying about Aubrey shows that they're not as close as she was with her previous friendships, since Aubrey won't tell Kim what's going on in her life. Then it hurts again when her old friends leave her again when she looked like she needed them. My interpretation of what happened in the past based on the present is she only socially isolated Basil calling him a creep though, and Kim or someone else was the one who initiated the bullying/violence on him. Despite what happened, Aubrey really isn't that different of a person from Dream Aubrey. She still is that kind deep inside, and maybe also still has feelings for Sunny. Even though I know she's still a good person, it doesn't change the fact that what she did was wrong and I can't condone her behavior. She's an interesting character to me since she has the dichotomy of being kind and caring as Mari or Sunny, but also violent and callous (mostly to strangers or people she's offended by) as Kim. I'm not sure who she got the baseball bat from, was it her father or Mari? I'm not sure if she put nails in it because she wanted to make it a better weapon, or because she was that hurt and it's the same as running a pin through a voodoo doll, but something interesting I noticed about the bat is that there are no points sticking out, they're all inside the bat and only the heads or blunt parts would cause more bruising if she hit you with it...not that it makes it any better. I think she got it from her father, since in Kim and Vance's dad's house she shows she learned some handyman skills someone, and it's most likely her father unless she did self-help internet things, but because there's nails in the bat I'm more inclined to believe it's from her father. Maybe even her bike is from her dad too, if she didn't buy it herself. Questions I do have though are: Did her mom always neglect her even before her father left or what? It's possible that just like her friends, she pushed her mom away too because of both her father leaving and Mari's death, creating the situation today? Do they live off child support (if it exists), or did her mom go out and work? Why do the churchgoers blame Aubrey more than her mother? What does Aubrey even eat? Gino's with friends or works part time at Fix-it or Gino's since she has her own bike? Why didn't the dad get custody? Is it because Aubrey wanted to stay in Faraway? Did anything happen to her at school when she was alone that made her toughen up her exterior, or was it just because she hung out with the hooligans? Well, besides that I just can empathize a lot with her from what we can know, infer, and have learned about her. Mostly her feelings though, not necessarily her life. Well, I have been the one to violently retaliate in situations when provoked, but I'm not really proud of it. I usually give people three chances, if the first time only annoyed me a bit or didn't make me angry I just leave it. If they keep doing something and/or it's clearly on purpose, or maybe I even got physically hurt I pick up the chair, the desk, and if there's nothing that else I could use that wouldn't actually kill someone, maybe just my fists. Well, I chased them but I didn't always get them. The most dangerous weapon I had was my backpack though. I carried all my textbooks because of an incident that made me not use lockers, so it was like 10~20 lbs of blunt weaponry that I had around at all times. I think...it might be scarier than a steak knife or a nail bat? I don't think I've made a joke that I was beating them with knowledge though, if I ever did bash someone with it. ^(I might have for some especially terrible people, though.) Hm, an afterthought I had, was it possible she always just felt really sad inside and it turned to anger and/or frustration? I know when I held my sorrows in when I was younger and even sometimes in the present while playing Omori so I wouldn't cry in front of someone else, my pent up sadness felt stressful or maybe even the time I was really angry. Maybe that's what she meant it's more complicated? Or maybe in another way. ^(I would make fun of Kel's mole too.) I was antagonized too throughout my life, the same way Kel does to Aubrey in the game. Didn't justify any of what I did in retaliation though.\n\nIf I haven't already made it clear enough that Aubrey is someone with a rough exterior but soft interior, here's some manga that can give you some perspective: Gokushufudou, Tonari no Furi-san ga Tonikaku Kowai, Furyou Taimashi Reina, and if you can handle Horror (although I think it's more gross and unnerving than scary) you can check for the man loved by cats in Mieruko-chan too, since I don't remember the chapter for him. There's more, but these are the ones I can remember off the top of my head.\n\nIf you just want to fantasize more about shipping Sunny and Aubrey: That Girl is Not Just Cute/Shikimori's not just a Cutie, Straightforward Girlfriend, and Boku no Kanojo wa Saikou desu! (Well, for this one it might be more of a fantasy for a universe where Mari didn't die or after they are able to move on.) are some good ones, maybe Toradora and Horimiya too? Of course it won't be exactly the same, but just some fantasy fuel. There's probably some more, but I can't remember as of now.\n\nWhat would you call Aubrey if she's outdated?\n>!Aubsolete!<\n\nNow for Basil. He's also an interesting character to me, because he's the most tragic character, the deuteragonist, and the secondary antagonist as well. He's a good person, but he did the greatest evil. The road to hell is paved with good intentions is the most fitting quote for Basil. Granted, he wasn't in the right state of mind at all, but he ended up ruining his friends' lives, and his own. The lie that Mari committed suicide haunted Hero, Aubrey, and Kel for years. Or in other words, he may have created a Something not just for himself and Sunny, but the rest of his friends, the only difference being that they couldn't see theirs. The tree that he hung Mari on was Sunny's favorite tree, getting it cut down by Sunny's father. It explains why the toy box was under the tree since Sunny would like to play there with his toys, and also why Basil was split into the one he once knew or Dream Basil, and \"Stranger\", where he sees Basil as a monster or Something for deciding to hang Mari...so Sunny had double the trauma of accidentally killing his sister, and a newfound fear or just \"Who are you?\" of Basil.  Then when Aubrey came over and discovered the photos, covering up for Sunny. In that scenario, it would have been better for Aubrey to find out, and in her fury go to Sunny's house and discover the terrible condition Sunny was in too, since it's mentioned she didn't know how much in pain the others were and that she was pushing them away. This is only theoretical, but since he didn't seem to respect others' alone time, is it possible that he stressed out Mari and Sunny a bit before the recital too? It doesn't seem like Mari and Sunny really ever said no to Basil, when they might have needed to. Maybe Sunny could have been dreaming about playing the violin perfectly, and Basil woke him up and it caused him further frustration when he couldn't remember that sound. Mari could have been politely telling Basil to leave her be, but he ended up bringing everyone and getting Sunny after some begging when maybe he just wanted to lay down or sit and listen to Mari play the piano. So many maybes and what ifs from me.  I don't like Basil, but I also can't help but feel bad for him since his life was the worst both pre-trauma and post-trauma. He was the only one with a truly broken family all throughout the game/memories, Aubrey still had hers, and it only took a turn for the worse around the time Mari died, while Basil only had his grandma and a caretaker that may not have been Polly or was always her in the past 4 years. The reason he so desperately sought the affection of his friends, especially Sunny, was perhaps his heart was so broken, that all the love they gave him slowly bled out, and he always needed more. They gave him an inch, and he ended up taking a mile. Do we know whether his parents are dead or have they just abandoned him? I kind of want to know what he did in gardening to tie a noose, I don't think he was that suicidal or he hid it really well before the incident. The best I could guess was he knew how to make the noose sturdy enough to hold Mari's body because of all the hanging plants in his house, but that's three strings...right? I'm not saying Basil hasn't suffered either, he's been bullied for 3~4 years by one of his closest friends and the entire school due to a misunderstanding, the person he thought was his best friend was never by his side, though I do think Basil brought it upon himself by choosing to cover up for Sunny over and over. Honestly, a scenario I have thought of is what if Sunny hasn't scribbled out the photos? Maybe Aubrey and Basil would still be a friends for a while, but Aubrey might eventually leave him because she feels he's acting weird or creepy to her. Maybe no bullying. Most I could relate to Basil is the experience of a mental breakdown, I guess. Just feels like my brain is melting for a while, to the point I get physically sick for me. Fortunately, the only memories I lose are school related for classes. Unfortunately, one time I forgot the entire year of school and it was 1 month before final exams. I died inside. I can kind of understand why he went to gouge Sunny's eye too, I'm sure it was said before, but Basil thought it was Something. People told me and my sister we looked alike all the time. Of course, when we were younger we vehemently denied it. Nowadays, we just call each other ugly to insult each other as a tongue-in cheek joke where when we call one of us ugly, it's calling both of us ugly.\n\nIf you want to imagine a happy Basil without a broken life, there's quite a few manga with these kinds of flower boys in them. I didn't care much for them, so you'll have to do some searching on your own. Fuel for your Buffsil fantasies, on the other hand, you can go read The Strongest Florist. It wasn't my cup of tea, but it's there if you want it.\n\nIf you've seen or read Coraline, what also bothered me is Basil effectively stabbed half of Sunny's soul if you know what eyes mean from the context of the book/movie.\n\nWhat is the worst advice you could give Basil?\n>!Shearing is caring!<\n\nSunny and Basil may never see eye to eye again. Yes, this pun is tasteless and doesn't reflect my thoughts.\n\nKel, I would put Kel above Basil if he didn't play Basketball and wasn't gross. It's entirely personal that he's in last place. It doesn't help his case that he's the most relatively normal human being out of all his friends. Kind of feel like he's Navi from the Legend of Zelda to me, not a whole lot or as annoying but just a bit. He's a good person, but I felt that his EQ was a little too low, do I just have high standards? To me, let's use an analogy where his friends are all ticking time bombs and he's the person defusing the bomb, instead of trying the wires he just goes straight for the detonator. When he attempted to make Hero feel better, did he specifically tell us what he said? If he didn't, I'm quite sure Kel said, \"Mari wouldn't want to see you this way\" which drove Hero into a rage because that's what he's grieving about, he didn't know how Mari was feeling (perceiving it as suicide) then his own brother walks up to him and just says that, I'm sure Hero screamed \"What would you know about how Mari is feeling?!\" before going off on him. Well, we saw what happened with Aubrey, but yeah, Kel not worrying about her at all and only talking about Basil, who in her eyes was the criminal who ruined what was left of their childhood memories, hurt her in two ways and added fuel to the fire to the fights you had with her throughout the game. Not to mention he was only half right about saying that Aubrey looked and acted different, but she was the same person. Yes, I can agree Aubrey is fundamentally the same person, but he also ended up unintentionally denying the 4 years of life she had to experience without her friends, and her father. If we treat Headspace as a reflection of reality or Sunny's past, Kel would also be wrong that the Hooligans are Aubrey's \"new friends\", maybe they were already friends and all played together at the park, but they only recently became closer with Aubrey after Mari's death. Basil may not have had the suicidal urge either if he didn't know Sunny was leaving, and Kel ended up crushing his hope since his grandmother couldn't be there for him anymore even before she died. Not to mention he admits he left everyone high and dry for a bare minimum of 1 year before he started with Hero when his positivity was needed the most, the worst time to be considerate of others thinking he might hurt them more...I don't know. I think some of you give Kel too much credit for the True Route, it was a 50/50 at least since Sunny needed to leave the house and not go full Hiki. Maybe I'm just being too negative of everything. I wasn't there, what would I know? I do think Kel may have been forced to grow up too quickly because of Mari's death, or if he didn't mature that much maybe his trauma is just being less happy go lucky? Not sure, but I feel Kel has also changed in a subtle and simple way. I think what I find a little relatable about Kel is being the second child, but I don't think I've developed an inferiority complex (if he has one) and worried about being outstanding in another way, like since Hero wasn't athletic he played basketball, or maybe something like wanting to be taller than Hero. Maybe at first it was like that, but I now think he genuinely enjoys the activity. Most I've ever felt that kind of feeling is maybe when I cared more about money and got less new year's money because I was the second child? I've known quite a few people like Kel, except for the being kind part. I just want to roast him too. To me, Kel and reality have one thing in common, they are both often disappointing. I would tell him his choice of pants and his height have one thing in common too. >!Short.!< The road to Kell is paved with good intentions. ^(I'm done...for now.)\n\nRestaurant review company Kel owns?\n>!Kelp!<\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think they're all 6 of them are amazing characters for how they're portrayed and how I perceive them, but I only really liked Mari, Hero, and Sunny as a person. Aubrey I feel 50/50 about because though I understand her feelings the most, quite a few things that I can empathize with her are things I don't like about her either, let alone myself. Kel and Basil, I just didn't like at all. It might've been cool to have Kel have a chance to ignore enemy attempts to change his mood, or Aubrey goes from stage 1 emotion to a stage 2 without resetting to stage 1 when she switches emotions to show her \"complicated\" feelings, I think...but this is only my personal interpretation and not the truth of who they are, so it doesn't matter too much.\n\nI think the Hooligans deserve a mention too, though I'm not sure where I'd put them. Probably above Kel and Basil.\n\nKim's heart is in the right place like her dad says, but the way she goes about it is not right. She perceived Basil as a problem to Aubrey, and wanted to help, but I don't think bullying him (most likely physically) was the correct choice, considering how she ran her scooter into Basil at the start of the game. Was Aubrey just better than Kim at things impressing Kim making Aubrey the leader, or was she just being nice and let Aubrey be the leader of the hooligans? Been thinking about that, but eh, probably doesn't matter. Berly in Headspace.\n\nVance, a nice detail about him is that he's always got his sister's back. Actually, I'm a little jealous of what not only Sunny and Mari had but Kim and Vance. Hm. Van in Headspace. Also if you didn't notice, Kimberly Vance.\n\nCharlie/Charlene is just so precious. If you meet her at her house on the two days left afternoon, you end up becoming friends with her and she does the Dream Aubrey twirl. She also only punches you for 1 damage in the fight with Angel and her, and in the Hooligans lakebattle she never attacks (unless she does so at the 10%?). If you don't agree with me, then we can agree to disagree. Something to note is that Sunny always knew her name, though it was spelled Sharleen instead. How sweet.\n\nI just thought Mikhael was lame while trying to act cool. Good for him that Bebe fell in love with his confidence. I do hope he becomes a baker, then becomes the owner of a cafe or Pâtisserie and becomes actually cool in my eyes. Maybe I just like bread. He's Mikal in Headspace.\n\nAngel...I can't find a better word for him than chuunibyou. I still think he's pretty important if you did the side quest and ended up getting his Rare card from his sister. The wiki says he's Neb in Headspace, but I can't seem to make the connection myself.\n\nBesides the Hooligans though, you can also discover the connection between some characters you interact with Headspace and the people in reality, like Joy is Happy, Brent is Brows, Jesse is Bangs, Shawn is Sean, Ren is Karen, there's maybe more I've missed.\n\nSide quests might have been a bit boring, but they're all emotional investment for Sunny to come back to Faraway Town, or in Guitar Guy's case, a friend he'll have in the city too. I think they're all quite well made, and you get to learn a bit more about all the side characters and stuff, befriend the Hooligans for the most part, and even if theoretically his friends ditch him and Basil after learning the truth, there's still a reason to come back. Maybe he'll be able to make up with Aubrey through the Hooligans by befriending Angel then convincing the rest of the gang or some scenario along those lines...if I believed Aubrey wouldn't forgive Sunny.\n\nIf you didn't take the areas in Headspace or the Somethings literally, I have my own interpretation of them. Vast Forest and Pinwheel Forest represent Sunny's peaceful childhood, and in reality is equal to Faraway Park and the hangout spot. Otherworld represents more of his childhood, especially the time they spent at Hobbeez or with things they got from there. The Junkyard, I think just represents technological transition? Like, computers to laptops and home phones to cell phones, something like that. Pyrefly Forest to Sprout Mole Village and then Sweetheart's Castle is just a big mess. I think Sprout Mole Village is some of his childhood, Pyrefly Forest is how he feels lost in his puberty alone, and Sweetheart's Castle and maybe even Sweetheart herself representing his search for a love that cannot be found, because he's been alone for those 4 years and there's no one for him. Rather than considering the Last Resort as a literal place, I feel like it's a representation of Sunny's feelings, how he feels that others have moved and and his last resort would be to end the dream to move on as well. I have no idea what Humphrey is, either the 3 ways forward are Sunny considering whether he should be a cold, calculating person like a robot engineering, be the monster he thinks he is on the biology route, or do drugs to cope with the pain on the chemistry route? It could just be Humphrey is just a giant trash can and there's still some puberty around in the form of the Slime Girls. There is a fourth way which is none of the options and the one Sunny takes though, just going back. \n\nSomething in the Dark represents his fear that Mari won't forgive him, Something in the Walls represents his fear that Hero won't forgive him, and Something in the Water represents his fear of death since Mari is no longer around to save him. Of course, they can also represent his actual fears literally too. Why I think the last one is fear of death though, is spirit Mari mentions to Sunny/Omori that he's seen the window too. It could be all the fears are related to his near death incident too, he was high on the statue, prematurely jumped because of a spider that was on him, then almost drowned. Then to add onto the fear, the subconscious knowledge that Mari will no longer be around to save him if another accident befalls him.",

Read at your own risk if you don't plan on playing the game or some thought along those lines. A disclaimer that I may portray your favorite character in a more negative light based on what I know and think, so this post might become unpalatable to you. Well, you can also assume I did not do so great in English class because my thoughts are all over the place. It's quite stream of consciousness. I might repeat myself.\n\nHmm, I guess I could start off with my thoughts on the main six of the cast. I'll add some puns after each of the six because....why not?\n\nMari is my favorite, because although I do know she wasn't as perfect as others thought she was, she certainly did her best and was as kind as Sunny remembers her by. I also like listening to music with piano in it. She really did love Sunny, and he loved her back equally in return, if you piece together some bits and pieces on the true route, and in the Backyard Area in Black Space if you look off the cliff there's some Final Duet memories down there too. Kind of wish my sister was more like Mari too in terms of emotionally being there for me, though I knew she couldn't. Maybe that they were both perfectionists is the closest I can get, but my sister didn't enjoy that, so I doubt Mari did either and she was just trying to be a good role model or big sis for Sunny, or just the pressure of being the firstborn child which Mari could have shared with Hero. The reason why it took a turn for the worse and the incident happened is both because of cram school for college prep, and possibly Basil...but I'll get back to him later. She was really stressed out at the time too, and when Sunny needed a hug more than anything else like she always gave him, she tore into him instead or reprimanded him, \"How could you?\" or \"Don't you know how much effort your friends put into getting you that violin?\", maybe both those lines, one of them, and all the more. You can kind of see it in the truth photos that Mari was talking to him before he pushed her down. Looking at the truth photos even without the text that the wiki has or going through the files, and my personal experience with stairs, I don't think in any way she could have survived that. It looks like she fell backwards around 1/2 or 1/3 of the way on the stairs, bounced at least once if she covered half the distance and boy, those are some jagged looking stairs, probably broke her back then smashed into the violin with her front...sorry for the morbid picture but...that's how I see and feel how it happened. The worst that's happened to me is I slipped on my heel down some carpeted stairs, then just tumbled all the way down and slammed into the coat rack, not sure if headfirst or not. I think I got to experience the back pain of an old man for a while, and had to be carried up to my bed to rest. It still hurts thinking about it...^ sometimes I do wonder if I received any brain damage because of that too, but maybe it's just because it's easy for me to recognize when I'm being stupid.  I'll spoiler this part because it's a little gruesome. >!Throughout my childhood because I was clumsy, I ended up losing a few toenails to marble stairs, if not wooden stairs too while going up them barefoot or in slippers if it's outdoors. Sometimes fingernails too, sometimes it was only the white part, but sometimes I lost the up to half of the pink part too. It was an unpleasant and painful experience. Granted, recently I've tripped up only three steps while coming up from the basement on some old wooden stairs that had edges just as sharp in the truth photos, and I got a really nasty bruise that ended up turning purple later, and losing a quarter of my big toenail again.!< Stairs are pretty brutal, and that's only with me falling up or down like 1~5 steps on non-carpeted stairs. I can only imagine what happened to Mari. I find her sense of playfulness relatable. Gelatin is gelatin, after all. Maybe her consideration for others as well, but that's a trait she shares with Sunny too, or at least from what I know.\n\nWhat would have the police report on the incident with Mari be called?\n>!The staircase!<\n\nI hold Hero >!or Henry!< in high regards too. I know he wasn't naturally perfect though, I recognize he still put in the effort and made use of his talent to get where he was. He's actually the character I know the least about in comparison to Mari despite interacting with him in the Dream World and the present, I just know he's a nice guy and he's capable of being there for everyone, and a good cook too. His arachnophobia certainly got worse after Mari's death though. He was one of the characters who was hit the hardest by Mari's death though, considering everyone and their mother knew how close they were to each other, probably even considered them unofficially married. Actually, I can infer how terrible he felt at the time, because the present day dialogue when Kel asks Hero what is he going to do when he's no longer around to kill the spider for him, and Hero is like, \"What do you mean?\" It hits incredibly hard because he felt the same way for Mari, but she was suddenly gone and that he thought it was suicide made the pain exponentially worse. Between him, Kel, and Aubrey, who thought Mari committed suicide, he blamed himself the most for not seeing the signs that never existed, and ended up closing himself off from the world for an entire year until Kel waltzed in and ended up triggering him. One thing I don't like about him is how he chooses the middle ground though, like lukewarm tofu? Really? Even if he did pick a side, like let's say he picked Kel over Aubrey in the Dream World or the past while scratching his head and winking with one eye saying, \"Sorry Aubrey, but you're not the one catching the spiders for me.\", Aubrey would say that she could do it too, then Hero would still go back to, \"Then you can both catch spiders for me!\" and go back to making Kel and Aubrey feeling disappointed.  I've had someone like Hero in my life there for me, he wasn't any hero, but he certainly broke up some of the few fights I had with other kids, even if it was only at church on Sundays. \n\nThe word for saying someone has hero like qualities and also calling Hero gross?\n>!Heroic. Although, the k sound on just ick is a bit sharper...but whatever.!<\n\nAlso yes, while we're on Hero puns, Gator Aid is referring to the sports drink. \n\nWell, here we are at Sunny, but before I get into the warm, fuzzy stuff, I will state that I do feel that Sunny might have DID, considering he separated himself from Omori, and is also talking to himself through different characters he has made all throughout the Dream World, and I think Humphrey is a double layer of that, or maybe even critique of the Dream World, because Humphrey is both talking to Sunny while also talking to himself and...whatever. I'm no psychologist but I think you get the gist of what I'm thinking, but also I won't diagnose him in any way, I just think he might have DID post trauma, but it could be just DA...or maybe some really bad depression and he's trying to focus on only his good memories. I don't really know either. Well, Mewo and the stray cats like Sunny, and I like cats, therefore I like Sunny. Nothing more to it. I kid you, I like Sunny because he's as kind as Mari and loves everyone, you can see all the subtle nuances in which he cares for his friends all throughout the Dream World, and his past home where he goes to retrieve his violin. His friends are colored purple, which if you assume from Memory Lane that Aubrey wanted to dye her hair pink because it was her favorite color, then Mari's was purple and it's also symbolic that these are how Sunny remembers his friends were like when Mari was around. This also is shown by Dream Basil in how he's blanched and almost devoid of color, because it was sucked out of him to create Stranger. The Orange Joe quest actually was a representation of his friendship between Sunny and Kel, this is inferring from the photo album that Sunny's favorite fruit was lemons...or oragnes since Mari got him lemon ice cream, and also Orange Joe was throwing stuff around like Kel would, along with being a reference to the soda and Kel's favorite flavor being orange. The sad part about this though, was unlike Oragne Joe, the hope that Sunny created didn't come true when Orange Joe came into being. Kel did end up helping Sunny later, but I'll continue with Kel related stuff later. I think Sunny valued Aubrey second most to Mari considering how many Watermelons there were in the Dream World, and how much useful stuff you could get from them, you learn later that Aubrey's favorite fruit is watermelon. There's also one of the books where Sunny laid on Aubrey's shoulder and told himself he would cherish that memory forever. There's some hinting that they both had a thing for each other in Memory Lane too, and maybe even some more on the present day on the swings or when she's left alone with Sunny when Kel and Hero already went through the patio door.  Also this was the second most painful thing in the game to me.  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/405230654624628749/840373696668762122/how_much_did_sunny_really_need_aubrey.png  It's just an empty cardboard box...was it the weight of his sins or something? Did he really feel so helpless? Was he that weak? I don't know myself. It hurt more than anything else on the Hikikomori route to me. I don't know what I can reference to Hero in Headspace besides him being there though. Food heals or something along that line of logic? Being a lucid dreamer myself, I found it especially sweet  despite the psychological horror undertones  that he was always thinking of his friends, and remembered them for who they were  and still are  despite isolating himself for 4 years. You can see how much he cared about Mari since he didn't want to remember her dying again and the picnic blanket and all those things in Headspace, which the voice in the tunnel talks to you about post-Humphrey so I won't go too much into that. He still cares about Basil despite what he's done to him by keeping his entire garden around that you can water throughout the game, and remembers what Basil thinks of his friends through the flowers. No idea why his house is a boot though. If it follows the idea of \"shoes too big to fill\", a theory I do have on him which relies on seeing him as a selfish person and the line in the Photo Album where he calls Sunny the baby of the group and they should take care of him, perhaps that's why everything happened the way it did? I don't know if he idolized Mari or Hero, but maybe he felt responsibility as an older brother to Sunny, and felt the reason that Mari died was his own fault for not being a good role model to Sunny, leading to the cover up and trying to take responsibility for everything, unable to forgive himself until Sunny does in the true secret ending. But this also means it was less about caring about Sunny, and always was about him. If it means new pathways in life, it could represent that it's the entrance to Black Space and if you're on the True Route it's the way to a new beginning, and Hikikomori Route is a new hell. There could be also the implication based on a bad shoe pun where Basil is soulless, because the shoe is soleless. One thing I'm not sure of based on these two ideas are, is it Sunny's or Basil's thoughts? A mix even? The thought of white egret orchids coming into play here would make more sense if some of Basil's terror leaked into Sunny's dreams, no one said you had to be dead for it to work, and that's with the assumption of some supernatural elements at play. Post-Basil fight in Sunny's old house, you learn 5 new things, the tree that was cut down by his father was his favorite tree, Sunny knew Mari was tired because of cram school the entire time before the incident when you interact with the bookcase, if you interact with the lamp, Sunny slept after Mari because he knew she had trouble sleeping and had to turn off the lamp after Mari fell asleep while reading with the light on, interacting with her bed was how reliant Sunny was on Mari to overcome his nightmares, and interacting with his bed and revealing why he stayed in bed all this time, is that it was the most comfortable bed because it was Mari's old bed, and it reminded him of her...and maybe he rated Aubrey's bed as a 10/10 as well but didn't give us the score because...you know. It's all the more touching and sad once you find out those details, how could Sunny be the monster he thought he was? Well, the excerpt from the Lost Library tells you one of the stress factors he had was missing an hour every Saturday that he could have spent with his friends because of the lesson, I think a big plot hole might be why couldn't it be rescheduled, but it could have been about money if not parental neglect, I'm not sure. I did the math and it's about like 35 hrs lost of time that could have been spent with his friends, I know you didn't experience this scenario specifically, but what matters to you more, doing an activity you like or up to 8 hours of the slog that is school, not including the bus ride or homework?...if you didn't like school. But you will be able to understand, if not completely empathize with Sunny, thinking about doing something you like vs. what you don't like. Not to mention because of school taking up a lot of time that he couldn't spend with everyone those Saturday hours became all the more precious. Sunny understood logically why Mari couldn't spend time with him, but he may have felt heavily neglected still. Then there's Basil and Aubrey both complaining to him about things, and it's possible that since Basil was needy and Sunny didn't know how to say no, he ended up breaking promises to meet with Aubrey, among other things. There might be more stress related things that I may have missed, but then it becomes no surprise why things got heated and ended up the way they did. It would have been a lot less tragic from the get go if Basil didn't try to cover it up and they just found Sunny crying at the bed though, but once more I'll get back to Basil later and how he ruined everything for everyone. I am a bit curious about one thing, when have you guys taken a health/sex ed class? Before I learned about male and female genitalia, I must admit that I thought ample bosom or large chest= female and muscles= male. Do you think Sunny thinks the same way and it's not because of bisexuality? Best I could relate to Sunny is maybe having half the imagination he has, and having an older sister. She's only 2 and 9 months older than me though, and Mari is 3 years and 4 months older than Sunny iirc? Well...I'm ashamed to admit this but I did end up grabbing the kitchen knife and standing at the door to her room. I don't know what got into me that day either, and I don't remember much else after that besides no one got hurt physically, not sure about emotional. I do remember slowly walking up the stairs though, maybe I was hoping I would trip and fall on it? I think it was some time in high school though. I don't really know, maybe that's just why it's easier for me to forgive Sunny for what happened because I've done some terrible things, but those things didn't make me a terrible person in the eyes of others. I still think I'm terrible, but it doesn't eat away at me. ^ Sunny being lazy while they built the treehouse is a mood though.  I did find it adorable that he thinks lemons=oragnes and caffeine=coffee...though 150 mg of caffeine is equal to a Starbucks Espresso, Caffè Latte, or Cappucino. Jesus Kel, why do you drink Orange Joe? No idea why lemons are oragnes. Killing Omori didn't bother me that much after the first time, maybe I played too much Persona and treated him as Sunny's shadow? Also interesting to note that he's more of a Black Space entity due to his color scheme and his true nature. Hikikomori route felt revolting because it's one thing to plunge yourself into the abyss, but a whole 'nother feeling to plunge someone else into the abyss, fictional person or not.\n\nWhat is Omori's least favorite style of fried egg?\n>!Sunny side up!<\n\nWhat's Omori's favorite thing to do?\n>!Commit violince!<\n\nWhy is Sunny unable to enter some areas?\n>!Communication is key!<\n\nWell, here's a quote that I felt might fit Sunny/Omori from a game I played: \"On the mirrored edge of infinity, one man sinks forever into darkness, one man rises into light. But which one am I?\" You could google it and find the game if you want. Don't recommend playing it in its current state though.\n\nSo, here we are now at Aubrey. She was living a relatively normal life before her father left, so let's assume her house became the trash heap we see in the present in only 4 years. Those 4 years we didn't see were a rough time for her, her father left around the time Mari died so she had double the layer of suffering, then when she decided to reconnect with Basil and discovered the ruined photos she just flipped out from there. The long dialogue at the stump of Sunny's favorite tree reveals a bit more of how she felt at the time too. From what we see in the game, it seems she doesn't take the initiative whether it's bullying Basil or fighting Sunny and Kel, I think she was feeling inside \"But what about me?\" all the while Kel was only worrying about Basil and completely disregarding her feelings, while antagonizing her. The church part is only because Sunny was impatient though, but Kel still provoked her there, then finally at the lake for the last fight it's just Kel not believing them and starting the fight again. A little thought I'll add here, what if the song \"It Means Everything\" is referring to their memories together, or Basil's photo album, rather than just Aubrey herself? Or it could be her theme and it only changes to the others she's with the Hooligans. It could be both. Noticing her start to cry after the fight and run off, and also all the things that the churchgoers were saying, I actually cried for an hour, or maybe an hour and a half. Not for her though, just...some personal reasons. ^ Well, maybe a little for her too.  It also hurt when not only the Hooligans left her, but her old friends left her at the old hangout spot. It showed that except for Kim, the Hooligans weren't close to Aubrey like her old friend group, and even then with the lines Kim has while worrying about Aubrey shows that they're not as close as she was with her previous friendships, since Aubrey won't tell Kim what's going on in her life. Then it hurts again when her old friends leave her again when she looked like she needed them. My interpretation of what happened in the past based on the present is she only socially isolated Basil calling him a creep though, and Kim or someone else was the one who initiated the bullying/violence on him. Despite what happened, Aubrey really isn't that different of a person from Dream Aubrey. She still is that kind deep inside, and maybe also still has feelings for Sunny. Even though I know she's still a good person, it doesn't change the fact that what she did was wrong and I can't condone her behavior. She's an interesting character to me since she has the dichotomy of being kind and caring as Mari or Sunny, but also violent and callous  mostly to strangers or people she's offended by  as Kim. I'm not sure who she got the baseball bat from, was it her father or Mari? I'm not sure if she put nails in it because she wanted to make it a better weapon, or because she was that hurt and it's the same as running a pin through a voodoo doll, but something interesting I noticed about the bat is that there are no points sticking out, they're all inside the bat and only the heads or blunt parts would cause more bruising if she hit you with it...not that it makes it any better. I think she got it from her father, since in Kim and Vance's dad's house she shows she learned some handyman skills someone, and it's most likely her father unless she did self-help internet things, but because there's nails in the bat I'm more inclined to believe it's from her father. Maybe even her bike is from her dad too, if she didn't buy it herself. Questions I do have though are: Did her mom always neglect her even before her father left or what? It's possible that just like her friends, she pushed her mom away too because of both her father leaving and Mari's death, creating the situation today? Do they live off child support  if it exists , or did her mom go out and work? Why do the churchgoers blame Aubrey more than her mother? What does Aubrey even eat? Gino's with friends or works part time at Fix-it or Gino's since she has her own bike? Why didn't the dad get custody? Is it because Aubrey wanted to stay in Faraway? Did anything happen to her at school when she was alone that made her toughen up her exterior, or was it just because she hung out with the hooligans? Well, besides that I just can empathize a lot with her from what we can know, infer, and have learned about her. Mostly her feelings though, not necessarily her life. Well, I have been the one to violently retaliate in situations when provoked, but I'm not really proud of it. I usually give people three chances, if the first time only annoyed me a bit or didn't make me angry I just leave it. If they keep doing something and/or it's clearly on purpose, or maybe I even got physically hurt I pick up the chair, the desk, and if there's nothing that else I could use that wouldn't actually kill someone, maybe just my fists. Well, I chased them but I didn't always get them. The most dangerous weapon I had was my backpack though. I carried all my textbooks because of an incident that made me not use lockers, so it was like 10~20 lbs of blunt weaponry that I had around at all times. I think...it might be scarier than a steak knife or a nail bat? I don't think I've made a joke that I was beating them with knowledge though, if I ever did bash someone with it. ^ I might have for some especially terrible people, though.  Hm, an afterthought I had, was it possible she always just felt really sad inside and it turned to anger and/or frustration? I know when I held my sorrows in when I was younger and even sometimes in the present while playing Omori so I wouldn't cry in front of someone else, my pent up sadness felt stressful or maybe even the time I was really angry. Maybe that's what she meant it's more complicated? Or maybe in another way. ^ I would make fun of Kel's mole too.  I was antagonized too throughout my life, the same way Kel does to Aubrey in the game. Didn't justify any of what I did in retaliation though.\n\nIf I haven't already made it clear enough that Aubrey is someone with a rough exterior but soft interior, here's some manga that can give you some perspective: Gokushufudou, Tonari no Furi-san ga Tonikaku Kowai, Furyou Taimashi Reina, and if you can handle Horror  although I think it's more gross and unnerving than scary  you can check for the man loved by cats in Mieruko-chan too, since I don't remember the chapter for him. There's more, but these are the ones I can remember off the top of my head.\n\nIf you just want to fantasize more about shipping Sunny and Aubrey: That Girl is Not Just Cute/Shikimori's not just a Cutie, Straightforward Girlfriend, and Boku no Kanojo wa Saikou desu!  Well, for this one it might be more of a fantasy for a universe where Mari didn't die or after they are able to move on.  are some good ones, maybe Toradora and Horimiya too? Of course it won't be exactly the same, but just some fantasy fuel. There's probably some more, but I can't remember as of now.\n\nWhat would you call Aubrey if she's outdated?\n>!Aubsolete!<\n\nNow for Basil. He's also an interesting character to me, because he's the most tragic character, the deuteragonist, and the secondary antagonist as well. He's a good person, but he did the greatest evil. The road to hell is paved with good intentions is the most fitting quote for Basil. Granted, he wasn't in the right state of mind at all, but he ended up ruining his friends' lives, and his own. The lie that Mari committed suicide haunted Hero, Aubrey, and Kel for years. Or in other words, he may have created a Something not just for himself and Sunny, but the rest of his friends, the only difference being that they couldn't see theirs. The tree that he hung Mari on was Sunny's favorite tree, getting it cut down by Sunny's father. It explains why the toy box was under the tree since Sunny would like to play there with his toys, and also why Basil was split into the one he once knew or Dream Basil, and \"Stranger\", where he sees Basil as a monster or Something for deciding to hang Mari...so Sunny had double the trauma of accidentally killing his sister, and a newfound fear or just \"Who are you?\" of Basil.  Then when Aubrey came over and discovered the photos, covering up for Sunny. In that scenario, it would have been better for Aubrey to find out, and in her fury go to Sunny's house and discover the terrible condition Sunny was in too, since it's mentioned she didn't know how much in pain the others were and that she was pushing them away. This is only theoretical, but since he didn't seem to respect others' alone time, is it possible that he stressed out Mari and Sunny a bit before the recital too? It doesn't seem like Mari and Sunny really ever said no to Basil, when they might have needed to. Maybe Sunny could have been dreaming about playing the violin perfectly, and Basil woke him up and it caused him further frustration when he couldn't remember that sound. Mari could have been politely telling Basil to leave her be, but he ended up bringing everyone and getting Sunny after some begging when maybe he just wanted to lay down or sit and listen to Mari play the piano. So many maybes and what ifs from me.  I don't like Basil, but I also can't help but feel bad for him since his life was the worst both pre-trauma and post-trauma. He was the only one with a truly broken family all throughout the game/memories, Aubrey still had hers, and it only took a turn for the worse around the time Mari died, while Basil only had his grandma and a caretaker that may not have been Polly or was always her in the past 4 years. The reason he so desperately sought the affection of his friends, especially Sunny, was perhaps his heart was so broken, that all the love they gave him slowly bled out, and he always needed more. They gave him an inch, and he ended up taking a mile. Do we know whether his parents are dead or have they just abandoned him? I kind of want to know what he did in gardening to tie a noose, I don't think he was that suicidal or he hid it really well before the incident. The best I could guess was he knew how to make the noose sturdy enough to hold Mari's body because of all the hanging plants in his house, but that's three strings...right? I'm not saying Basil hasn't suffered either, he's been bullied for 3~4 years by one of his closest friends and the entire school due to a misunderstanding, the person he thought was his best friend was never by his side, though I do think Basil brought it upon himself by choosing to cover up for Sunny over and over. Honestly, a scenario I have thought of is what if Sunny hasn't scribbled out the photos? Maybe Aubrey and Basil would still be a friends for a while, but Aubrey might eventually leave him because she feels he's acting weird or creepy to her. Maybe no bullying. Most I could relate to Basil is the experience of a mental breakdown, I guess. Just feels like my brain is melting for a while, to the point I get physically sick for me. Fortunately, the only memories I lose are school related for classes. Unfortunately, one time I forgot the entire year of school and it was 1 month before final exams. I died inside. I can kind of understand why he went to gouge Sunny's eye too, I'm sure it was said before, but Basil thought it was Something. People told me and my sister we looked alike all the time. Of course, when we were younger we vehemently denied it. Nowadays, we just call each other ugly to insult each other as a tongue-in cheek joke where when we call one of us ugly, it's calling both of us ugly.\n\nIf you want to imagine a happy Basil without a broken life, there's quite a few manga with these kinds of flower boys in them. I didn't care much for them, so you'll have to do some searching on your own. Fuel for your Buffsil fantasies, on the other hand, you can go read The Strongest Florist. It wasn't my cup of tea, but it's there if you want it.\n\nIf you've seen or read Coraline, what also bothered me is Basil effectively stabbed half of Sunny's soul if you know what eyes mean from the context of the book/movie.\n\nWhat is the worst advice you could give Basil?\n>!Shearing is caring!<\n\nSunny and Basil may never see eye to eye again. Yes, this pun is tasteless and doesn't reflect my thoughts.\n\nKel, I would put Kel above Basil if he didn't play Basketball and wasn't gross. It's entirely personal that he's in last place. It doesn't help his case that he's the most relatively normal human being out of all his friends. Kind of feel like he's Navi from the Legend of Zelda to me, not a whole lot or as annoying but just a bit. He's a good person, but I felt that his EQ was a little too low, do I just have high standards? To me, let's use an analogy where his friends are all ticking time bombs and he's the person defusing the bomb, instead of trying the wires he just goes straight for the detonator. When he attempted to make Hero feel better, did he specifically tell us what he said? If he didn't, I'm quite sure Kel said, \"Mari wouldn't want to see you this way\" which drove Hero into a rage because that's what he's grieving about, he didn't know how Mari was feeling  perceiving it as suicide  then his own brother walks up to him and just says that, I'm sure Hero screamed \"What would you know about how Mari is feeling?!\" before going off on him. Well, we saw what happened with Aubrey, but yeah, Kel not worrying about her at all and only talking about Basil, who in her eyes was the criminal who ruined what was left of their childhood memories, hurt her in two ways and added fuel to the fire to the fights you had with her throughout the game. Not to mention he was only half right about saying that Aubrey looked and acted different, but she was the same person. Yes, I can agree Aubrey is fundamentally the same person, but he also ended up unintentionally denying the 4 years of life she had to experience without her friends, and her father. If we treat Headspace as a reflection of reality or Sunny's past, Kel would also be wrong that the Hooligans are Aubrey's \"new friends\", maybe they were already friends and all played together at the park, but they only recently became closer with Aubrey after Mari's death. Basil may not have had the suicidal urge either if he didn't know Sunny was leaving, and Kel ended up crushing his hope since his grandmother couldn't be there for him anymore even before she died. Not to mention he admits he left everyone high and dry for a bare minimum of 1 year before he started with Hero when his positivity was needed the most, the worst time to be considerate of others thinking he might hurt them more...I don't know. I think some of you give Kel too much credit for the True Route, it was a 50/50 at least since Sunny needed to leave the house and not go full Hiki. Maybe I'm just being too negative of everything. I wasn't there, what would I know? I do think Kel may have been forced to grow up too quickly because of Mari's death, or if he didn't mature that much maybe his trauma is just being less happy go lucky? Not sure, but I feel Kel has also changed in a subtle and simple way. I think what I find a little relatable about Kel is being the second child, but I don't think I've developed an inferiority complex  if he has one  and worried about being outstanding in another way, like since Hero wasn't athletic he played basketball, or maybe something like wanting to be taller than Hero. Maybe at first it was like that, but I now think he genuinely enjoys the activity. Most I've ever felt that kind of feeling is maybe when I cared more about money and got less new year's money because I was the second child? I've known quite a few people like Kel, except for the being kind part. I just want to roast him too. To me, Kel and reality have one thing in common, they are both often disappointing. I would tell him his choice of pants and his height have one thing in common too. >!Short.!< The road to Kell is paved with good intentions. ^ I'm done...for now. \n\nRestaurant review company Kel owns?\n>!Kelp!<\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think they're all 6 of them are amazing characters for how they're portrayed and how I perceive them, but I only really liked Mari, Hero, and Sunny as a person. Aubrey I feel 50/50 about because though I understand her feelings the most, quite a few things that I can empathize with her are things I don't like about her either, let alone myself. Kel and Basil, I just didn't like at all. It might've been cool to have Kel have a chance to ignore enemy attempts to change his mood, or Aubrey goes from stage 1 emotion to a stage 2 without resetting to stage 1 when she switches emotions to show her \"complicated\" feelings, I think...but this is only my personal interpretation and not the truth of who they are, so it doesn't matter too much.\n\nI think the Hooligans deserve a mention too, though I'm not sure where I'd put them. Probably above Kel and Basil.\n\nKim's heart is in the right place like her dad says, but the way she goes about it is not right. She perceived Basil as a problem to Aubrey, and wanted to help, but I don't think bullying him  most likely physically  was the correct choice, considering how she ran her scooter into Basil at the start of the game. Was Aubrey just better than Kim at things impressing Kim making Aubrey the leader, or was she just being nice and let Aubrey be the leader of the hooligans? Been thinking about that, but eh, probably doesn't matter. Berly in Headspace.\n\nVance, a nice detail about him is that he's always got his sister's back. Actually, I'm a little jealous of what not only Sunny and Mari had but Kim and Vance. Hm. Van in Headspace. Also if you didn't notice, Kimberly Vance.\n\nCharlie/Charlene is just so precious. If you meet her at her house on the two days left afternoon, you end up becoming friends with her and she does the Dream Aubrey twirl. She also only punches you for 1 damage in the fight with Angel and her, and in the Hooligans lakebattle she never attacks  unless she does so at the 10%? . If you don't agree with me, then we can agree to disagree. Something to note is that Sunny always knew her name, though it was spelled Sharleen instead. How sweet.\n\nI just thought Mikhael was lame while trying to act cool. Good for him that Bebe fell in love with his confidence. I do hope he becomes a baker, then becomes the owner of a cafe or Pâtisserie and becomes actually cool in my eyes. Maybe I just like bread. He's Mikal in Headspace.\n\nAngel...I can't find a better word for him than chuunibyou. I still think he's pretty important if you did the side quest and ended up getting his Rare card from his sister. The wiki says he's Neb in Headspace, but I can't seem to make the connection myself.\n\nBesides the Hooligans though, you can also discover the connection between some characters you interact with Headspace and the people in reality, like Joy is Happy, Brent is Brows, Jesse is Bangs, Shawn is Sean, Ren is Karen, there's maybe more I've missed.\n\nSide quests might have been a bit boring, but they're all emotional investment for Sunny to come back to Faraway Town, or in Guitar Guy's case, a friend he'll have in the city too. I think they're all quite well made, and you get to learn a bit more about all the side characters and stuff, befriend the Hooligans for the most part, and even if theoretically his friends ditch him and Basil after learning the truth, there's still a reason to come back. Maybe he'll be able to make up with Aubrey through the Hooligans by befriending Angel then convincing the rest of the gang or some scenario along those lines...if I believed Aubrey wouldn't forgive Sunny.\n\nIf you didn't take the areas in Headspace or the Somethings literally, I have my own interpretation of them. Vast Forest and Pinwheel Forest represent Sunny's peaceful childhood, and in reality is equal to Faraway Park and the hangout spot. Otherworld represents more of his childhood, especially the time they spent at Hobbeez or with things they got from there. The Junkyard, I think just represents technological transition? Like, computers to laptops and home phones to cell phones, something like that. Pyrefly Forest to Sprout Mole Village and then Sweetheart's Castle is just a big mess. I think Sprout Mole Village is some of his childhood, Pyrefly Forest is how he feels lost in his puberty alone, and Sweetheart's Castle and maybe even Sweetheart herself representing his search for a love that cannot be found, because he's been alone for those 4 years and there's no one for him. Rather than considering the Last Resort as a literal place, I feel like it's a representation of Sunny's feelings, how he feels that others have moved and and his last resort would be to end the dream to move on as well. I have no idea what Humphrey is, either the 3 ways forward are Sunny considering whether he should be a cold, calculating person like a robot engineering, be the monster he thinks he is on the biology route, or do drugs to cope with the pain on the chemistry route? It could just be Humphrey is just a giant trash can and there's still some puberty around in the form of the Slime Girls. There is a fourth way which is none of the options and the one Sunny takes though, just going back. \n\nSomething in the Dark represents his fear that Mari won't forgive him, Something in the Walls represents his fear that Hero won't forgive him, and Something in the Water represents his fear of death since Mari is no longer around to save him. Of course, they can also represent his actual fears literally too. Why I think the last one is fear of death though, is spirit Mari mentions to Sunny/Omori that he's seen the window too. It could be all the fears are related to his near death incident too, he was high on the statue, prematurely jumped because of a spider that was on him, then almost drowned. Then to add onto the fear, the subconscious knowledge that Mari will no longer be around to save him if another accident befalls him. https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/ndz1u5/thoughts_on_the_game_and_extra_continued_in/",

My therapist suggested this idea that I really want to work with, but I need a little help from you.\n\nI am a huge believer in the power of music.  Keeping with that, my therapist has suggested that I make different playlists for myself.  For waking up, for sleeping to, for working out, etc\n\nI started researching to make the playlists, but I thought it'd be great if I could get some help from others.\n\nI've given a link that will lead you to a spreadsheet I have going for this.  I don't think it's set up so that anyone can make changes (I wonder if that exists), but you can put it in a comment and I'll add it.\n\nIt is my hope that this gets big.  Not just for my own use though.  I know a couple of people in my group that are not as motivated as I am to put this kid of thing together, but would benefit greatly from something like this.  \n\nEach playlist has a little 'rule' for it.  I put that there as a general guideline for me so that I don't try to put a heavy metal song in with the music that's supposed to be lulling me to sleep...LoL\n\nAnd the 'Playlist to Sing to', if you wanted to suggest a song there, any song that is catchy and well known, pretty much any Disney song, I'm a 90s kind and love musicals.  However, feel free to suggest any song that you find yourself singing with...I love new songs!\n\nUm...I think that's all I need to tell ya.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10BDtf9akqrvjelWaAvp4171CLmKuo7d4Ctev1ElgJIE/edit?usp=sharing",

I got reminded of this cause I believe it was someones cover of Sound of Silence but I can’t find it on youtube. What I can remember is in this video the person singing started the song off standing on the top of a building top looking down on people (I think school children? I cant be sure though) and as he is singing the song, the people change into different shapes like a house and maybe a bike? I could be wrong about that but I do distinctly remember them turning into a house and it was a group of people changing into different shapes or pictures like a marching band and the camera was looking down on them.

They race to the top to but sadly as they got to the roof the first person is being lifted by a bird demon. https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/z2qqq6/tomt_music_video_about_depression/",

I can't remember the group's name but I know either the album name or group name had September (or maybe February, but I think Sep) involved and the group name was a couple words.  One of the songs on the album used the word \"bleak\" or \"bleakest\" and was definitely super bleak, maybe positioned 7th-10th on the album.

In the end, one breaks down and loses the battle and the other lives.\n\nI can't find the song but it's very nice to listen to, If the description of the video rings a bell let me know, thanks in advance : . https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/ojh6um/tomtsong2000s_music_video_where_man_lives_his/",

I don't remember who was collabing with who and I don't know their names because it was the only song I listened to from them. I distinctively remember california being mentioned though there is the possibility that pikmen meme with California girls playing jumbled my mind. It was definitely some sort of popular state though. Like said in the title it was about being a depressed music artist and maybe being popular. \n\nI hope your day is well !! https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/168yybm/tomt_song_song_about_being_a_depressed/",

I think there were also some mentions of>!suicide/self harm.!< It had the visuals sort of similar to Room of Depression. I think the game may have been an indie game because I never see it anywhere else.\n\nI can't really remember what the game's objective was, but I remember being in a house and you had to solve things using different clues by going into different rooms in the house. Every now and then you'd pick up a note that was a bit dark. (usually the talks of>! self harm!<). The game was really small because the whole screen was white, with the room you were in, being a small square in the middle of the screen. I don't think you ever left the house either. I'm pretty well sure the game had no music at all, if any sounds at all, which only made it more eerie. There were no other NPCs involved in the game as well I believe, just the player. The game was pretty confusing, yet also limited at the same time, and I remember my sister and I being stuck which eventually lead to us quitting the game. We deleted it off our console as well. It wasn't a paid game, it was either a free game or a demo.\n\nI think the title had something with depression/anxiety in it, but I could be wrong with that too. I've looked up games about it but I can't find anything. Again, the game had a really dark and eerie feeling to it.\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this.

   "body": "I've been looking for this music video for a bit now, I want to go back to it every once in a while but I can never find it and it's borderline impossible to search for without knowing any of the lyrics, the artist or the song title.\n\nThe music video is a white guy playing acoustic guitar (really narrows it down I know lol), I believe he had blonde or dirty blonde hair, he's covered in tattoos, there's no backup, he's in the middle of a rural area somewhere out in the sticks and there are multiple parts where he's singing while holding his own severed head, this would be the key feature of the music video that I'd say stands out the most. The song is very depressing, I believe it's about addiction and well, depression. It's not country, but it's got some folk influences, but almost sounds like it has some vague hip hop and R&B influences which are evident in the dude's singing. It's not from an extremely well known artist, possibly indie, it's sort of a neo-folk song, and it sounds very mid 2010's.\n\nI wish I could give more details, you can see why I'm having such a hard time finding this damn thing lol.",

The song is very depressing, I believe it's about addiction and well, depression. It's not country, but it's got some folk influences, but almost sounds like it has some vague hip hop and R&B influences which are evident in the dude's singing. It's not from an extremely well known artist, possibly indie, it's sort of a neo-folk song, and it sounds very mid 2010's.\n\nI wish I could give more details, you can see why I'm having such a hard time finding this damn thing lol. https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/18ppv1o/tomt_looking_for_a_music_video_based_on_the/",

I attempted to play it on the keyboard:\n\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AvtqEdLJ6QRcgfdeJUF7FI978nE3eA\n\nThe tempo and keys may be off  I know basically 0 about music theory etc 🥲  and the instrument may be other, but I’m very confident about the melody/harmony  ? again sorry for my ignorance in the area \n\nI also remember it had a girl ?  singing in a soothing/depressing voice. I only remember a very small portion of that though, so apologies in advance: https://voca.ro/13gcj55wDdMC\n\nI’m not sure when or where exactly I heard it, but it was most certainly recently, and though I’m not sure if the song is recent as well I have the impression it is. Possibly was an automatic “Play Next” from Apple Music, but I’ve already looked at my listening history and no luck :   https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/199h8qt/tomtsong_what_is_the_song_with_this_melody/",

Thank you! \n\nOk, so, I’ve been looking for this vocaloid music video/song titled “Not Enough”, I remember the name since it was written in English. However, I’ve been unable to locate either the music video or the song since it got deleted from YouTube. I remember the song being more on the somber side with lyrics referencing depression. Sadly, I do not recall the name of the producer or the voice bank used for the song itself (I’m pretty sure it was Miku). The way she was tuned was similar to Oonuma Parsely’s work, mainly like their song “[Colors](https://youtu.be/2IsBcAjUBVg?si=GkxhMmDe4R_mILGy)”. With that said, I do not believe Oonuma Parsely made the song I’m looking for. \n\nFortunately, I recall the visuals of the music video rather vividly. I even made a reaction of the visuals [here](https://imgur.com/a/oWApNU5). The music video featuring the song had this looping visual of a person with long hair in a red shirt holding their head in anguish with a large red circle behind them in a white room. The visuals would glitch out in different ways to the beat of the song. I remember listening to it at around 2017-2018 I believe? I had it in my favorite playlist for the longest time until the video seemingly disappeared.\n\nAdditionally, I remember someone making their own mv replacing the person in the red shirt with Kokichi Ouma from Danganronpa V3. But I cannot find that video either.\n\nIf anyone knows the song, or any information regarding it, please let me know! Moreover, if there’s proof of the og producer wanting their content to remain private, I’ll respect that. I was just curious why it was removed from Youtube. Thank you for your time!",

I remember it traumatizing me every time i saw it.

It was airing on either Mtv or Vh1 between 1996 and 2002 (in Hungary tho but it was definitely in a foreign language cuz i didn’t understand anything). \nThe plot (as far as i can remember) was very disturbing and depressing, a boy was trapped in a prison or some sort of underground(?) cell, trying to escape and counting the days that he spends there till he grows into a old man and dies(?). \nThe video was in black and white, very dark and suffocating also the scenery felt really muddy and wet.\nThe music felt quite depressing as well, i think it was some sort of alternative rock song with a male vocal.\nAny tips would be highly appreciated🫶🏻",

The thing that really stood out to me at the time was the ending, where the red headed (?) woman featured in the video appeared as a skeleton, with the red hair, in a coffin. It spooked me which is why I remember that specific part. I think the rest involved the woman in a castle with a fancy… medieval perhaps? dress/gown with possibly a flower crown or some sort of headwear.\n\nI don’t think it’s very popular as it only played once on the TV, and I never saw or heard of it again. This has been nagging me for so long and no one else may know about it, but I want to take the chance anyway.\n\nPlease, please tell me of you know what song/music video I’m talking about.

   "merged_text": " TOMT  French music video of a fantasy-Victorian-ish  ?  type scenery In the 2010s I often went to a bar in France which would have a TV screen that would play music videos, and once it played this particular music video that has me losing my mind over trying to find it again.\n\nI may be misremembering it because I searched and searched with all sorts of key words and I couldn’t find anything, so I’m resorting to making a public post.\n\nFrom what I can vaguely recall, it had this ethereal, depressing moody vibe with lots of brightness. The thing that really stood out to me at the time was the ending, where the red headed  ?  woman featured in the video appeared as a skeleton, with the red hair, in a coffin. It spooked me which is why I remember that specific part. I think the rest involved the woman in a castle with a fancy… medieval perhaps? dress/gown with possibly a flower crown or some sort of headwear.\n\nI don’t think it’s very popular as it only played once on the TV, and I never saw or heard of it again. This has been nagging me for so long and no one else may know about it, but I want to take the chance anyway.\n\nPlease, please tell me of you know what song/music video I’m talking about. This will haunt me for years. https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/173mxlj/tomt_french_music_video_of_a_fantasyvictorianish/",

   "body": "So there’s this vocaloid song I used to listen to a lot along with rolling girl, I think it was a Miku song but I could be wrong. \n\nIt’s more rock sounding, and there’s a part where the MV is like [this drawing](https://pasteboard.co/IYPsFZbTf9xq.jpg) kind of but instead of stick figures it’s a school girl. It might have red in it too. I remember the left one also sinks down and the right one comes up maybe where they are getting closer to each other. \n\n For some reason I remember it having something to do with a doppelganger, or there being chairs/desks or something in it. \n\nIt's kinda like the \"Monkey Mane Chair Stealing Game\" could also have been \"Dear Doppelganger\" but I don't think it’s either of these. \n\nI think that it was kinda rock music ish and there was a heavier metal sounding part at one point i think. \n\nI don’t remember any of the words but i the vibe i got was like facing your alter ego and fighting off bad vibes/depression or succumbing to them or something. Or even just simply having 2 personalities. \n\nI genuinely have no idea and have tried to find it for years.

   "merged_text": " TOMT  Rock Vocaloid Song Where MV was Black and White maybe red too, and on the left is an upside down girl and the right they stand normal. Might have doppelgänger in the title. So there’s this vocaloid song I used to listen to a lot along with rolling girl, I think it was a Miku song but I could be wrong. \n\nIt’s more rock sounding, and there’s a part where the MV is like  this drawing  https://pasteboard.co/IYPsFZbTf9xq.jpg  kind of but instead of stick figures it’s a school girl. It might have red in it too. I remember the left one also sinks down and the right one comes up maybe where they are getting closer to each other. \n\n For some reason I remember it having something to do with a doppelganger, or there being chairs/desks or something in it. \n\nIt's kinda like the \"Monkey Mane Chair Stealing Game\" could also have been \"Dear Doppelganger\" but I don't think it’s either of these. \n\nI think that it was kinda rock music ish and there was a heavier metal sounding part at one point i think. \n\nI don’t remember any of the words but i the vibe i got was like facing your alter ego and fighting off bad vibes/depression or succumbing to them or something. Or even just simply having 2 personalities. \n\nI genuinely have no idea and have tried to find it for years. Looked on vocaloid db, scoured youtube for an hour and a half today alone. \n\nI appreciate all of your help and suggestions! https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/18sjno8/tomt_rock_vocaloid_song_where_mv_was_black_and/",

   "body": "**Platform(s):**\n\nSteam. I'm 100% I saw it on steam. No idea if available anywhere else. \n\n**Plot:**\n\nIt's some 'meta-game' in which it takes place within a game. The cartridge is damaged or something and it's up to the hero to fix it or at least persist in this glitchy, dying, distorted world. Plot is incredibly similar to Lenna's Inception but 3D and the characters appeared to be self-aware the world was fading. Way more depressing than Lenna's Inception too. \n\nThe game was made by an indie developer. \n\n**Genre:**\n\nSemi-top down like Zelda. The render below has the exact perspective, 65 degrees or something. You just hack and slash your way to save the world or something. It had an inventory system. I think you may have been tasked with retrieving parts of a shattered cartridge. Idk. \n\nDespite appearing similar this game was not a soulslike. I didn't even know the term soulslike when I saw it. \n\n**Estimated year of release:**\n\nI saw this between 2013 and 2017. I know I never saw it after that. I remember browsing the Steam page and watching the trailer, deciding not to play it because of how depressing it looked.\n\n**Graphics/art style:**\n\nHere's the render. I recreated it from memory. \n\n[Image](https://charinusraps.neocities.org/galleria/1011101%20Render.png)\n\nThere was a bit of fog not present in the render but that's almost verbatim what I remember. The horizon was a bit darker. All models were low-poly. Like just a bunch of cubes together. What I rendered is almost exactly how the character looked (not down to colours though, I think they were even more washed out).\n\nIt was incredibly grim and depressing looking. Lighting was old-school with all models just lit up. Everything had a brown haze to it. It didn't have that VHS-aesthetic Itch.io has and I swear this game predates that. It was just Low-Poly but smoothed. Like if you play Duckstation with smoothing on. Smooth like this the models in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekX1QQtVFdI\n\nOnly thing missing from the render was UI which I cannot recall at all. \n\n**Notable characters:**\n\nThe main character didn't have a name last I recall. You were just some nameless hero. \n\n**Notable gameplay mechanics:**\n\nYou could probably weaponize glitches and distortion but I do not know for sure. \n\n**Other details:**\n\nI know for a fact I saw it between 2012 when I started using Steam more and 2017 because I know I would have bought it then. It was released pre-covid, 100%.\n\nThe game's name was something like 1010110110: Subtitle. It might not have even had a subtitle but I remember vividly the name being a random assorts of binary. At least, I think it was binary. I've gone on Steam and tried 010, 011, 000, 001, 111, 110 and 101 and sorted by alphabetical and can't find it. Also tried it on IGDB and I can't find it either. \n\nI don't think the game was unlisted but that's always a possibility. \n\nAlso I keep associating the game with Skrillex. Can't figure out why it keeps coming up. I don't listen to his music and I haven't been able to see if he composed music for something like this. It doesn't make sense. \n\nI vaguely remembering the title having something about RAM or memories or dust or blowing or skipping or something. The numbers in the title are what I remember most and remembering thinking the dev shouldn't have called it that; making it impossible to find. \n\nAnyone have any idea?",

What's strongly imprinted in my memory is that the people's facial expressions were sad, tired, depressed, and sometimes angry during the dance, which gave an ironic and uneasy feeling while watching it.\n\nDoes anyone know the name of the song  music video  I'm describing?

I think the video was mostly animated, but it was like a dark choppy abstract animation with a lot of strange industrial visuals. I remember a few different parts. One scene, the main guy is walking along with his head down. He's animated in that weird choppy style as mentioned before. There's another part where he is sitting at a piano and you see a close-up of his hand playing a riff on the keys (more choppy animation). Two parts that were particularly memorable to me:\n\n1. there are these flames that have that dark artistic animated look, but the motion of their flickering looks like real flames.

   "merged_text": " TOMT  MOVIE  1960s Movie about the life of a depressed middle class man, revolving around his family, his work and the meaninglessness of his life in general I saw this one on Youtube a few years ago. It is probably a TV show, a very obscure one. I didn't finish it when I first saw it, so my description of the plot is going to be incomplete. The movie starts with some melancholic music and an image of water running in dark background. The movie is very slow paced, and it's just about a man going around his life with his family and his workplace. It is implied that he has untreated depression, and he starts to become nihilistic because of his depression. At one point I looked the movie up on IMDB and the movie has a sequel. The sequel is about the same man, but this time he has realized that he has depression and seeks help.\n\nAny idea? https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/kug0eg/tomtmovie1960smovie_about_the_life_of_a_depressed/",

   "body": "Ok, so this post might get a bit messy since I watched this when I was 5 and only saw it a couple of before I turned 7 and somehow my family just lost it. I know this movie definitely came out before 2010 so that rules out anything after that. It was a thriller/supsense/horror type of movie. It was probably a 90's or 2000's movie because the movie had a pretty noticeable green tint and also the camera work matched up with other movies that came out at that timeframe. I remember the DVD menu and the box art itself having that green tint which was pretty noticeable. The DVD menu had depressing music in the background and that green tint like i said before. On to some of the details of the actual movie, it was about these group of people who im sure were pretty young, I literally cannot remember how it starts at all and only remember stuff in the middle.\n                                                      They find this house and one of them knocks on the door but I don't think anyone answers because he tries knocking on it again more angrily this time saying stuff about whoever was inside being a pussy (Not sure if there was anyone inside). Skip forward a couple of scenes because like I said, I can barely remember, they do get into a house but there is this old woman in it who I guess let them stay there. Things go wrong and I think it turns out that the woman was crazy? She puts on clownish type makeup and scares them I think. I remember there being a Jumpscare and without a doubt in my mind, she was old. Thats all I remember as I'm not even sure If the women was trying to hurt the group in any way. Needless to say it was probably a pretty mid attempt at a horror movie because even my 5 year old self wasn't scared by it. I hope this all makes sense and someone could help me. Thank you.",

   "body": "Hello, I am from Russia and for some time this memory has been in my head. So I wanted to ask other people to help me find what was this all about. So the quick history is this. Probably around 2013-2015, I guess, I was watching TV after school instead of doing homework or something more productive. I stubled upon this animated short. It's like in this creepy end of Soviet era type of a cartoon style you probably know about. I did not start watching it from the beggining and have no memory what channel this was from, I think it was one of the smaller cartoons channel that would air everything considered a cartoon.  I know that I watched it till the end but don't remember how it ended eigher, it had very creepy/depressing vibe amd was hard to watch and it felt longer than it actually was. This cartoon was done in a somewhat crude hand drown style, the main colors were gray, dark shades of blue ans green, they were lots of brutalist style surreal buildings, staircases and other scenery, the sky was black or dark gray. The main hero was middle aged some sort of office worker that was very desparate to leave this maze-like city only to find dead ends every time. There was as also a character in a suit with a TV for a head or even multiple of this creatures, it did not chase the main hero, but showed up from time to time to mock or distract him. There were no voice acting aside from some grunts, laughs or screams, there was some music, not sure if it was electronic or orchestral, but it must've been made for this short, there were also some moments where there was no music. Here are some scenes that might have been here but they could also be false memories: the hero sees line of people that look just like him mindlessly walking inside the buildings like slaves, the hero finds a spot without buildings only for the to rapidly grow infrom of him forming another dead end, TV person showing him a woman in a dress kissing the camera. I hope you can help me figure out what it was.",

   "title": "I'm clinically diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder - AMA",
   "body": "Before you jump to asking, let me give some background and better context. Read it all, because it'll probably answer a good bit of questions and you'll save yourself some time. \n\n**What is it and what isn't it?** You've all most likely heard of psychopaths and sociopaths, but probably in the wrong context. First there has to be a few distinctions, and we should throw out some common ideas and stigmas. There isn't a set criteria that defines psychopathy/sociopathy. It's more of a spectrum, like a lot of mental disorders such as autism. Psychopathy and sociopathy both \"fall\" under Antisocial Personality Disorder, though neither term is actually really used in medicine. Psychopaths are usually born, sociopaths are usually made, which is a key difference. I would be a \"psychopath\" but like I said, those terms are really not used in medicine, mainly just by media. For the rest of this post, I'll be talking about being a \"psychopath\" instead of sociopathy, and I'll use the term psychopath but just for common understanding, remember it's hardly a correct term. \n\nIt's important to understand that, generally, psychopaths struggle with **empathy**, but not so much with **sympathy**. The best way I've heard this explain is: with **empathy**, I *feel* what you feel; with **sympathy**, I *understand* how you feel. I do not struggle with sympathy, nor am I some sort of emotionally dumb robot. I don't know if I speak for every \"psychopath\" but I understand feelings fairly well, I just don't \"feel\" them the same way others do. But honestly, how can anyone be so sure that they feel emotions the same way as others?\n\n**Emotions** \\- It's not that psychopaths can't feel anything at all, I think we just experience emotion differently. There may be some that don't experience it at all, there are varying degrees of psychopathy, but I would say the vast majority struggle with remorse and guilt. I can feel happiness, I can feel anger, but It's probably different from how others feel it. I really don't feel things like sadness or remorse, and I especially feel lost with how to respond when people cry. But I do understand them. \n\n**Background** \\- I was first taken to a psychiatrist (or psychologist, I don't remember) around 11 or 12 years old. I had been homeschooled until 3rd grade, when my teacher recommended my parents get me screened for ADHD because I seemed \"distant\" from other children, and lacked \"interest\" in others. My parents told me this. The psychiatrist at the time eventually agreed partially and put me on some sort of medication, I don't remember. Over the next few months though, the psychiatrist took me off the medication and informed my parents he didn't think it was ADHD and that I was showing signs of APD, but that I was too young to make a diagnosis. He didn't use the word psychopath of course, my parent's thought it meant  something more along the lines of depression or being an introvert, and he told my parents I could grow out of it. I did have therapy over the next several years, there was a focus on understanding others. I was officially \"diagnosed\" at 18 when nothing improved in terms of my capability to feel emotion.\n\nIt's important to note that I had a good and stable childhood. No abuse or anything like that. My parents were always good and didn't treat me differently from my siblings.\n\n**Education** \\- Psychopaths are not geniuses like you see in media. Or at least maybe I just got the short end of the stick. I would say throughout school I was \"above average\" compared to others, but by no means superficially talented or gifted. I'll be attending medical school soon, and I had to work just as hard as everyone else. Maybe there's some advantages- a lot of people get test anxiety, I don't. But I'm not sure that's something held specifically by \"psychopaths.\" I want to be in medicine because it genuinely fascinates me, and I believe I can provide great patient care even given my condition. \n\nI have musical education also, I play classical piano and violin. I listen to mainly classical music in general. I would say feeling less emotion does put me at a disadvantage here, in fact I can remember several times the feeling of great frustration whenever my piano teacher would advise me that I'm not playing with emotion. I typically like to obey the score.\n\n**Violence** \\- this is the one everyone loves to jump to. There's definitely a connection with \"psychopaths\" and violence, undoubtedly so. But not every psychopath is a violent being. I'm not, I have some pretty violent thoughts on a regular basis, but from my understanding I think most people do. I did have some violence against animals as a kid- I'm not going to go into details cause I'm not sure that's accepted, but know it wasn't anything gruesome. That was taken care of as I got older, and nowadays my dog is probably my closest companion and the closest I've come to feeling \"love\" with something. I've not been violent towards people outside of the occasional verbal anger outbreak or my thoughts. I did punch my brother a few times when I was younger, but not much outside that. \n\n**Relationships** \\- Another one people love to jump to. I've been in several relationships, 1 long term one (about 1.4 years). No I've never cheated, but I would say the majority of them have ended because of me getting bored. I don't think that means me being an asshole, I really did get bored with them. Usually I've done it over text so I wouldn't have to deal with the sobbing and whatnot, but I do understand now that doing that probably does make me look like a genuinely bad person. Typically, I do stay in a relationship for the sex. No, I've never forced any sort of sexual act on anyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk anything you want. I understand some of you probably don't believe this, as it looks like a lot of people make this claim. Doesn't really matter to me, I wanted to make this post to see what people think about \"psychopaths.\"",

Over the next few months though, the psychiatrist took me off the medication and informed my parents he didn't think it was ADHD and that I was showing signs of APD, but that I was too young to make a diagnosis. He didn't use the word psychopath of course, my parent's thought it meant  something more along the lines of depression or being an introvert, and he told my parents I could grow out of it. I did have therapy over the next several years, there was a focus on understanding others. I was officially \"diagnosed\" at 18 when nothing improved in terms of my capability to feel emotion.\n\nIt's important to note that I had a good and stable childhood. No abuse or anything like that. My parents were always good and didn't treat me differently from my siblings.\n\n**Education** \\- Psychopaths are not geniuses like you see in media. Or at least maybe I just got the short end of the stick. I would say throughout school I was \"above average\" compared to others, but by no means superficially talented or gifted. I'll be attending medical school soon, and I had to work just as hard as everyone else. Maybe there's some advantages- a lot of people get test anxiety, I don't. But I'm not sure that's something held specifically by \"psychopaths.\" I want to be in medicine because it genuinely fascinates me, and I believe I can provide great patient care even given my condition. \n\nI have musical education also, I play classical piano and violin. I listen to mainly classical music in general. I would say feeling less emotion does put me at a disadvantage here, in fact I can remember several times the feeling of great frustration whenever my piano teacher would advise me that I'm not playing with emotion. I typically like to obey the score.\n\n**Violence** \\- this is the one everyone loves to jump to. There's definitely a connection with \"psychopaths\" and violence, undoubtedly so. But not every psychopath is a violent being. I'm not, I have some pretty violent thoughts on a regular basis, but from my understanding I think most people do. I did have some violence against animals as a kid- I'm not going to go into details cause I'm not sure that's accepted, but know it wasn't anything gruesome. That was taken care of as I got older, and nowadays my dog is probably my closest companion and the closest I've come to feeling \"love\" with something. I've not been violent towards people outside of the occasional verbal anger outbreak or my thoughts. I did punch my brother a few times when I was younger, but not much outside that. \n\n**Relationships** \\- Another one people love to jump to. I've been in several relationships, 1 long term one  about 1.4 years . No I've never cheated, but I would say the majority of them have ended because of me getting bored. I don't think that means me being an asshole, I really did get bored with them. Usually I've done it over text so I wouldn't have to deal with the sobbing and whatnot, but I do understand now that doing that probably does make me look like a genuinely bad person. Typically, I do stay in a relationship for the sex. No, I've never forced any sort of sexual act on anyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk anything you want. I understand some of you probably don't believe this, as it looks like a lot of people make this claim. Doesn't really matter to me, I wanted to make this post to see what people think about \"psychopaths.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/kf83ou/im_clinically_diagnosed_with_antisocial/",
